<p><a href="#chap1">Return to top</a></p>

<p>Market entry strategies are as follows:</p>

<p>Secure an agent, representative, or distributor in Colombia, which requires a contract that meets the provisions of the Colombian Commercial Code.</p>

<p>Focus on formality, personal relationships, and trust when negotiating agreements and contracts.</p>

<p>Communicate with the U.S. Commercial Service and the Economic sections of the U.S. Embassy in Bogotá regarding specific concerns.</p>

<p>Offer excellent after-sales service arrangements and maintain the sales relationship. Warranties or guarantees on imports are critical for supporting after sales service in Colombia.</p>

<p>Provide high quality products and/or services, affordable financing and competitive pricing. Support your local partner’s marketing efforts with advertising campaigns or by participating in trade shows. Do not be hands off; visit often. Spanish-language sales collateral and service manuals are essential, and may be required in certain sectors, like medical products. U.S.-based staff with a strong knowledge of Spanish is certainly helpful.</p>
