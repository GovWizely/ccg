<h4>Overview <a href="#chap4">Return to top</a></h4>

<p><img src="../images/wheat.png" alt="Wheat" /></p>

<p>Wheat production is marginal in Colombia and is expected to average about 24 thousand metric tons annually. Colombia’s wheat is primarily of low quality and is not likely to expand. Under the FTA, the U.S. wheat enters Colombia with zero duty and no quota. Prior to FTA implementation, U.S. market share fell due to duty preferences for imports from the Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR) and Canada. FTA implementation created more favorable trade circumstances for U.S. wheat with greater opportunities for trade.</p>

<h4>Best Prospects/Services <a href="#chap4">Return to top</a></h4>

<p>FTA implementation has greatly helped the United States to recover lost wheat import market share at the expense of Canada and MERCOSUR. Zero duties and no quota will create more competitive trade conditions against MERCOSUR wheat, which is subject to a price band mechanism, where duties fluctuate based on a reference price. Canadian wheat, which also has zero duties and no quota, will be the primary competitor.</p>

<h4>Opportunities <a href="#chap4">Return to top</a></h4>

<p>While bread consumption in Colombia remains low, there has been a steady increase in Colombian pasta consumption creating increased demand for high-quality Durum wheat.</p>
