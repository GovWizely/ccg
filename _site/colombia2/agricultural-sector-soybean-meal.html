<h4>Overview <a href="#chap4">Return to top</a></h4>

<p><img src="../images/soybean.png" alt="Soybean" /></p>

<p>The oilseed meal supply in Colombia is composed mainly of soybean meal, cottonseed meal, palm kernel meal, and sesame seed meal. All fishmeal used in the country is imported from Perú, Chile, and Ecuador. The FTA eliminated duties on all imports of U.S. soybeans and soybean meal. Primary competitors are MERCOSUR countries.</p>

<h4>Best Prospects/Services <a href="#chap4">Return to top</a></h4>

<p>Total domestic consumption of soybean meal and palm kernel meal are forecast to</p>

<p>make up 90 percent of Colombian vegetable meal used for animal feed production.</p>

<p>U.S. export market share of soybean meal to Colombia dramatically dropped to 5 percent against MERCOSUR countries in recent years. Zero duties and no quota under the FTA have greatly helped soybean meal exports recover and expand market share against competitors.</p>

<h4>Opportunities <a href="#chap4">Return to top</a></h4>

<p>The FTA has created new opportunities for U.S. exporters and investment opportunities for new oilseed crushing facilities and feed manufacturing plants in Colombia. Soybean meal imports will continue to increase in the following years due to a rising middle class and shifting dietary patterns towards more animal protein that generates a significant demand for more animal feed to satisfy primarily the poultry and swine sectors.</p>
