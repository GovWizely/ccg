<h5>Market Estimates</h5>

<p><img src="../images/travel-market-estimates.png" alt="Argentina" /></p>

<h5>Overview</h5>

<p>Traveling is part of the Argentine lifestyle and the U.S. is a popular destination for both business and pleasure. Based on the most recent figures travel to the U.S. is up 19.2 percent January to November 2012, compared to the same period in 2011. Although Argentine tourism has grown at double digit rates over the past years, growth in 2013 could slow due to GOA restrictions on the purchase of foreign currency and taxes on airline tickets to non-Argentine destinations and credit card charges made by Argentine tourists when overseas. During 2014, many Argentines will likely choose Brazil as a travel destination due to its proximity as well as to attend the popular FIFA World Cup (Copa Mundial de Furbol) hosted by Brazil.</p>

<p>The Commerce Departmentâ€™s Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that Argentines spend $5,000 per person on travel expenses to the U.S. (including airfare generated by U.S. carriers). This comes as good news for travel agents, airlines, destinations, hotel managers, and many other travel service providers.</p>

<p>The number of travelers varies seasonally. Peak travel times tend to be during the summer holidays (December-February) and winter school holidays (July) although some choose to travel during the week of September 21st, as many children receive a spring holiday then in addition to their other times off.</p>
