<h3>Market Overview</h3>

<p>Welcome to Argentina! The U.S. and Argentina share a long history of bilateral commercial relations both in trade and investment. The United States is Argentina’s third-largest trading partner and U.S. companies are among the top investors with some U.S. companies maintaining local sales and manufacturing subsidiaries in the country for over a century. Argentina is an important regional export market for the United States, with a population of 42 million people – the second-largest economy in South America and the fourth most populous country in Latin America.</p>

<p>The United States and Argentina share a mutually beneficial trade relationship with total bilateral trade in goods and services nearing $23 billion dollars in 2012. The U.S. supplies raw materials, intermediate goods, and capital goods to feed Argentina’s industrial sector while Argentina exports food, agricultural products, and intermediate goods to the U.S. The U.S. enjoys a trade surplus with Argentina; approximately 90 percent of its exports to Argentina are destined for local industry and agriculture such as computers, industrial and agricultural chemicals, agricultural and transportation equipment, machine tools, parts for oil field rigs, and refined fuel oil. Argentine exports to the U.S., meanwhile include goods such as wine— Argentina is one of the largest exporters of wine to the U.S.—fruit juices, crude oil, and intermediate goods such seamless pipe, tubes, and other iron and steel products.</p>

<p>U.S. investment makes a large contribution to Argentina’s economy. Over 500 U.S.-based companies currently operate in Argentina, employing over 155,000 Argentines. The stock of U.S. investment in Argentina reached $13.3 billion in 2011 (latest data available) and is concentrated in the energy, manufacturing, information technology, and financial sectors. U.S. firms operating in Argentina continue to make a positive impact on the Argentine economy and society and are widely respected for their corporate governance, the quality of the work environment they provide to their Argentine employees, their transparency, and their work in corporate social responsibility. In 2012, U.S. companies comprised nearly 1/3 of the 100 most respected companies in Argentina published annually by Argentina’s largest newspaper, <em>Clarin</em>.</p>

<p>Return to top</p>

<h3>Market Challenges</h3>

<p>The primary market challenges arise from slowing economic growth, and foreign exchange and import restrictions. The outlook for the Argentine economy is uncertain in 2013 due to various factors including lower commodity prices (expected to trend somewhat downward from the historic highs of recent cycles) and economic disruptions caused by foreign exchange and import restrictions the Government of Argentina (GOA) imposed in late 2011 and early 2012. GDP growth slowed markedly in 2012 to 1.9 percent from 8.9 percent in 2011; according to official statistics (the IMF and some private analysts believe the official statistics may overstate growth). Strong commodity prices and automobile exports to Brazil have contributed to Argentina’s rapid growth over the past several years. Non-automatic import licenses (NAILs) were ended late last year for all but a few products, but a regime erected by the GOA in February 2012 that requires all importers to request approval from the Argentine Tax and Customs Authority (AFIP) prior to making each purchase for imports is still in effect and constitutes import licensing in all but name. This system is a subject of a WTO complaint by the U.S. and other countries against Argentina. Moreover, the GOA’s policy of tying the percentage of import application approvals to changes in the trade balance and foreign exchange levels has added to the uncertainty.</p>

<p>Sustained inflation generally estimated at 25+ percent has raised the unit labor costs and resulted in a more challenging business environment, especially as the real effective exchange rate has appreciated. Limits on profit remittances have also discouraged new investment in Argentina. Lack of transparency and a public comment period for new regulations adds to business uncertainty, as does the lack of a credible national statistics agency. As a result of the aforementioned government policies, many local and international firms based in Argentina have put a hold on plans for expansion or the adoption of new product lines until the economic climate and regulatory regime become more clear, consistent and predictable.</p>

<h3>Market Opportunities</h3>

<p>This Country Commercial Guide presents information for companies to determine the market potential of the Argentine market. This year’s top market sectors are: Agricultural Machinery Parts; Electronic Security Equipment; Food Processing Equipment; Information and Communication Technology; Medical Equipment, Instruments &amp; Supplies; Mining Equipment; Renewable Energy, Travel &amp; Tourism to the United States; and Food Ingredients. In the agribusiness sector bull semen and planting seeds are key areas with high potential.</p>

<p>We encourage you to work with the U.S. Embassy to explore opportunities in all sectors. Services offered to American firms in Argentina include help with market-entry or expansion strategies and advocacy for tender bid and policy obstacles. The U.S. Embassy also stands ready to help U.S. companies understand and address market challenges.</p>

<p>In addition to the services of the U.S. Embassy, the U.S. Export-Import Bank is open for short-and medium-term financing for U.S. exports to private sector clients in Argentina, but not for entities tied to the GOA. The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) offers assistance to U.S. private investors in the form of political risk insurance, as well as loans and loan guarantees for their direct investment in Argentina.</p>

<h3>Market Entry Strategy</h3>

<p>• Marketing U.S. products and services in Argentina requires a high level of research, preparation, and involvement.</p>

<p>• Companies intending to export to Argentina need to ensure that their customers fulfill all import requirements. They should contact the U.S. Commercial Service in Argentina for advice.</p>

<p>• U.S. companies exporting to Argentina typically market their products and services through Argentine agents, representatives and distributors.</p>

<p>• Close personal relationships are important.</p>

<p>• U.S. companies must consider Argentina’s unique economic, demographic, and cultural characteristics that distinguish it from other Latin American countries.</p>

<p>• It is increasingly difficult to establish a "typical customer" due to new consumption habits and to the dynamics of income distribution and demography.</p>

<p>• An important component of the marketing mix is promotion. Companies are encouraged to visit or exhibit at local and regional trade shows, and to visit trade shows in the United States attended by Argentine buyers.</p>

<p>• Protect your intellectual property and engage qualified local professionals and lawyers in contract negotiations.</p>

<p>The U.S. Embassy Commercial Service in Argentina provides a wide range of services to help U.S. companies enter and expand operations in the country. For details on the services offered, see: <a href="http://export.gov/argentina/servicesforu.s.companies/index.asp">http://export.gov/argentina/servicesforu.s.companies/index.asp</a>.</p>

<h3>Using an Agent or Distributor</h3>

<p>International companies typically market their products through an Argentine agent/representative or a distributor. Working with a distributor has several advantages. Distributors can provide strategic support for positioning brands in the market through promotion and advertising. Furthermore, they understand the local culture and can assist with after-sales service. This value-added service is increasingly important for customers and contributes to a positive image of U.S. firms doing business abroad. Due to import restrictions there are situations in which the best solution is a representative. To discuss this further, please <a href="http://export.gov/argentina/contactus/index.asp">contact us</a>.</p>

<p>The Civil and Commercial Codes govern principal-agent relations and differ from U.S. laws. We strongly recommend that an Argentine lawyer be consulted prior to entering into any type of agreement with an agent/distributor and engaged prior to substantive negotiation of the agreement terms. No special legislation has been enacted to regulate the cancellation of agency/distribution agreements, although a company could incur additional costs associated with the cancellation of an agency agreement under Argentine labor law. Given the complexity of the legal and commercial environment, contracts are generally negotiated in writing through the exchange of reversal letters or via a basic instrument. The parties may not elect foreign laws to govern the agreement. Argentine courts will not enforce a contract executed abroad to avoid Argentina law.</p>

<p>U.S. companies should take time in selecting their Argentine agent/distributor. Business relationships and a good reputation are essential to an agent/distributor’s ability to reach potential customers of your product or service. The mutual trust that this builds will help prevent business disputes and help resolve them amicably when they do arise. The U.S. Commercial Service of the U.S. Department of Commerce assists exporters in finding and evaluating partners in Argentina.</p>

<p>Contact the nearest U.S. Department of Commerce Export Assistance Center, where trade specialists can provide you with guidance on entering the Argentine or other international markets. Please call 1-800-USA-TRADE (1-800-872-8723) to locate the one nearest you or visit the U.S. Government Export Portal at <a href="http://export.gov/eac/">http://export.gov/eac/</a>. You may also contact us at the U.S. Commercial Service in Buenos Aires directly for additional information on partner search services, applicable fees and delivery times.</p>

<p>Return to Top</p>

<h3>Establishing an Office</h3>

<p>Foreign companies may carry out any single transaction. To carry on a routine activity, a foreign company must establish a branch (<em>sucursal</em>) in Argentina. An individual must be appointed as the company's legal representative, but assignment of capital to the branch is not necessary.</p>

<h4>Legal Structures Commonly Used by Investors</h4>

<p>Regardless of whether they are associated with local investors, foreign investors may do business in Argentina as individuals or through corporations, branches of foreign corporations, limited liability companies, limited partnerships, general partnerships, and joint ventures. Foreign corporations often operate in Argentina through a separately incorporated subsidiary rather than through a branch, primarily to reduce their potential liability. If a branch is used, all of the foreign corporation's assets, not only its Argentine assets, may be subject to potential liability. In contrast, if an Argentine or foreign subsidiary is used, the foreign corporation's liability generally will be limited to the assets owned by that subsidiary.</p>

<p>Registration Procedures: a law effective throughout Argentina regulates corporations. Corporations are set up with the approval of at least two legal or natural persons, whether Argentine or foreign.</p>

<p>A corporation may not be a partner in a partnership. A corporation can usually be established in three to four weeks if capital is supplied only in cash. If supplied in kind, the corporation can be established in about two months. A minimum of two founders is required with no maximum limit. Company founders must report a domicile in Argentina.</p>

<p>A minimum of two shareholders is required. No maximum is prescribed. Should a foreign company wish to act as shareholder of a local company, the company must be “qualified.” The cost of qualification proceedings is similar to the incorporation cost.</p>

<p>U.S. firms considering establishing operations in Argentina should fully investigate the tax and legal aspects of establishing a business with legal counsel before making any final decisions. To obtain a list of law firms, please <a href="http://export.gov/argentina/contactus/index.asp">contact us</a>.</p>

<h3>Franchising</h3>

<p>The local franchising industry is a challenging and highly competitive environment for international franchisors seeking local partners. Current market size is approximately $5 billion, with an annual growth rate of approximately 10 percent. Franchising sales account for approximately 2 percent of Argentina’s GDP. Currently, 88 percent of local franchises are of Argentine origin and approximately 12 percent are of international ownership.</p>

<p>There are 612 franchise brands, encompassing 27,621 units that employ approximately 165,000 people. During 2013, it is projected that approximately 2,700 new units will be opened in the marketplace, mainly in the apparel and food sectors. Tourism and health are two new segments in which franchising are growing.</p>

<p>The most popular areas for international franchisors are apparel, fast food, foreign language training, dry cleaning, hotels, and car rental services. Local franchises have been particularly successful in apparel, food, ice cream, "empanada" pastries, fitness/health clubs, and education. Coffee shops and stores are currently going through a growth stage, with local brands such as Havanna and Bonafide having more than 120 stores each. Starbucks entered the Argentine market in 2008, opening over 30+ stores since entrance. Other significant U.S. market players include Kodak Express, McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy’s, Cartridge World, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and Re-Max.</p>

<p>Franchise contracts are generally protected under the Argentine Commercial Code and are not governed by specific legislation. The scope of the service, commercial trade market/name, expertise, and shared production elements are covered by contractual obligations on both franchisor and franchisee. Elements of the contract include the license, methods/systems or proprietary information transferred to a franchisee, inputs supply, sales methods, quality standards, and ultimate control by franchisor of the contract elements.</p>

<p>Franchises have been successfully used in Argentina, but the obligations of the franchisor must be clearly established in the contract to avoid potential liabilities related to the operator, such as default, bankruptcy, etc. There are initiatives to advance a Franchising Bill to fully formalize the industry, but legal counsel should be sought prior to entering the Argentine marketplace and appointing a franchisee.</p>

<h3>Direct Marketing</h3>

<p>E-commerce is increasingly a part of daily life, particularly given a higher penetration of home broadband connections. Traditionally, companies that sell cosmetics, kitchenware, fragrances, and books have been most likely to utilize direct marketing tools. However, the increasing use of the Internet is enabling other firms/sectors to penetrate the market. Companies selling household consumer goods, electronic devices, merchandising, books and CDs, computer hardware, tourism services, and cars publish their product catalogs on-line.</p>

<p>Some imported products are marketed directly through cable and satellite TV programs. Mail-order marketing is still not as widespread in Argentina. Mail distribution prices remain high, while duties and other taxes to be paid on international mail order merchandise depend on the nature of the product or mode of shipment. In addition, there are restrictions on imports of printed material.</p>

<p>Return to Top</p>

<h3>Joint Ventures/Licensing</h3>

<p>Argentine legislation permits the establishment of temporary associations, equivalent to joint ventures, known as UTEs (<em>Unión Transitoria de Empresas</em>). This is an association of two or more individuals or companies that contribute assets to develop or perform a particular transaction in Argentina or outside the country using Argentina as its base of operations. UTEs are not considered companies or legal entities in their own right. Participants may be resident businesspeople, locally constituted entities, or non-resident companies that have established a separate branch or other type of Argentine presence.</p>

<p>A contract must be signed and registered with the Public Commercial Registry at the Office of the Inspector General of Justice (<em>Inspección General de Justicia</em>) in the Federal Capital, or its provincial equivalent. The contract must contain the objective, duration, name and other specific information regarding the partners' responsibilities, financial contribution, and many other specific clauses. It must also provide for the appointment of a legal representative in charge of management.</p>

<li>Procurement from Local Companies</li>
<li>Buy Argentine Preferences</li>
<li>Preferential Treatment</li>
<li>Foreign Goods</li>
<li>Disputes</li>
</ul>


<p>Decrees 436/2000,1023/2001 and 1818/2006 together with Resolution 515/2000 establish the rules applicable to federal government purchases. They can be downloaded (in Spanish) from the following web site: <a href="https://www.argentinacompra.gov.ar/">https://www.argentinacompra.gov.ar/</a>.</p>

<p>These regulations apply to all federal public agencies (including autonomous or decentralized institutions), but exclude federal banks. They also establish the amounts determining the selection process. Government purchases of less than AR$75,000 undergo direct purchase. Purchases between AR$75,000 and AR$300,000 undergo private bidding, but purchases over that amount must have an open public tender.</p>

<p>Advertising and publishing procedure terms apply regarding important contracts in main publications and Internet sites such as the National Contracting Office (Oficina Nacional de Contrataciones - ONC) as well as in the Official Bulletin and publications of suppliers associations. Requirements for first-time sales to the government depend on the type of provider. Information should be submitted in writing and in the form of a diskette.</p>

<p>The ONC is the agency supervising procurement for the National Public Administration. This Office is part of the Secretariat of Public Management, Chief of Cabinet.</p>

<p><strong>Contact Information:</strong></p>

<p>Website: <a href="https://www.argentinacompra.gov.ar/">https://www.argentinacompra.gov.ar/</a></p>

<p>Most provincial governments have their own web sites with procurement information. Unión Argentina de Proveedores del Estado (UAPE) is a prominent NGO looking out for the interests of companies participating in national, provincial, and municipal procurements. UAPE has a database of government procurements. More information can be found at <a href="http://www.uape.org.ar/">http://www.uape.org.ar/</a>.</p>

<h4>Procurement from Local Companies (“Buy Local” Regime)</h4>

<p>Law 25551, issued on November 2001 and implemented by Decree 1600/2002, established the “Buy Argentine” Regime. The "<em>Compre Trabajo Argentino</em>" regime obligates all government agencies, public and privatized utilities, and concessionaires to purchase domestic materials, goods and products, provided that the price is "reasonable" (<em>precio razonable</em>) and the performance is identical or similar (<em>idénticas o similares prestaciones</em>) to that of the imported/foreign goods offered, as defined by regulatory Decree 1600/2002 of August 28, 2002. In March 2011, the Argentine Senate approved an amendment to Law 25551, extending the entities subject to the “Buy Argentine” regime. The draft law is still pending in the Argentine Lower House Committees.</p>

<h4>Buy Argentine Preferences</h4>

<p><em>Goods</em>: Preference is given to domestic goods. The origin of the goods shall be determined by the nature/composition of the goods themselves, not based on the nationality or ownership of the manufacturing company. Goods containing imported parts shall be considered domestically produced when the value of the imported parts is no more than 40 percent of the sales value of the finished good, or when the imported product undergoes substantial in-country transformation such that the MERCOSUR tariff classification code of the transformed item differs from that of the imported part.</p>

<p><em>Services</em>: Preference will be given to bids submitted by a domestic company or consultant.</p>

<p><em>Public Works</em>: Preference will be given to domestic materials and to domestic services (i.e., project design, management, and construction services) as defined above.</p>

<h4>Preferential Treatment</h4>

<p>In cash payment conditions, when the cost of the domestic good is five (for small firms) to seven percent higher than the cost of the imported/foreign good, the contracting party should select the domestic good. In the case of deregulated markets, the contracting party should select the domestic goods when the value quoted is equal to or lower than that of the imported/foreign goods. This requirement applies only when the domestic goods meet all the requirements set forth in contracting documents and can fulfill expected functions (<em>idénticas o similares prestaciones</em>).</p>

<h4>Foreign Goods</h4>

<p>When a bidder offers to supply foreign goods not available in country, they must guarantee "nationalization" of the goods by depositing a bond on behalf of the contracting party. In addition, the Secretariat of Industry will issue a certificate verifying the value of the goods to be purchased abroad at the request of the contracting party within 96 hours of receiving said request. To obtain the Certificate of Verification (<em>Certificado De Verificación-CDV</em>), the contracting party must submit a sworn statement declaring (1) that it has complied with the <em>Compre Argentino</em> regime; (2) the end price or value of the foreign goods; and (3) that said price or value is lower than that of domestic goods offered or that no domestic goods were offered.</p>

<h4>Disputes</h4>

<p>When the selection of imported/foreign goods is challenged, the Secretariat of Industry will determine if the domestic goods offered meet all the requirements set forth in the contracting documents and can fulfill the expected functions (<em>idénticas o similares prestaciones</em>) in the same manner as the imported/foreign goods selected. The Secretariat may request the advice of the National Institute of Industrial Technology (<em>Instituto Nacional de Tecnología Industrial-INTI</em>) or any other body accredited by the Argentine Accreditation Organization (<em>Organismo Argentino de Acreditación -OAA</em>). If the challenge fails, the challenging party pays the costs of the Secretariat's intervention; if the challenge succeeds, the bidder offering the imported/foreign goods pays the costs.</p>

<p>Argentina is not a signatory of the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement, but it is an observer to the WTO Committee on Government Procurement.</p>

<h3>Distribution and Sales Channels</h3>

<ul>
<li>Warehouse and Distribution</li>
<li>Land Transportation</li>
<li>River and Maritime Transportation</li>
<li>Air Cargo</li>
<li>The Retail Network</li>
</ul>


<p>90 percent of the Argentine population is concentrated in urban areas, with over 40 percent living in Buenos Aires and its suburbs, and approximately another 30 percent in the cities of Cordoba, Rosario, and Mendoza combined.</p>

<p>Channel selection should be based on the nature of the product and the company's knowledge of the Argentine market. Generally, firms new to this market find it more effective to sell through a distributor. Large firms generally buy directly from overseas suppliers, while smaller firms prefer to buy through intermediaries. Industrial equipment is sold by sales agents or through trade fairs, while consumer goods are increasingly sold through large outlets such as supermarkets. Argentine distribution channels have gained increased efficiency through merging and streamlining as a result of the increased competition and changes in the consumer buying process.</p>

<h4>Warehouse and distribution</h4>

<p>Distribution in Argentina tends to be radial, with all roads converging on the Port of Buenos Aires. This dates back to the turn of the century, when Argentina's rail and road systems were developed by the British to bring products to the Port of Buenos Aires to satisfy the foreign demand for commodities. The hub-oriented distribution approach used in the U.S. does not yet exist in Argentina.</p>

<h4>Land Transportation</h4>

<p>Argentina stretches 4,000 km (2,500 mi.) from north to south, an expanse crossed by only a few major highways. Argentina's 208,350 km (129,462 mi.) road network carries 85 percent of domestic freight traffic. Argentina has over 35,000 km (21,000 mi.) of railroads, but quality and speed vary widely. In general, the rail network requires significant investment to bring it up to international standards of speed and reliability.</p>

<h4>River and Maritime Transportation</h4>

<p>Almost 70 percent of Argentina’s foreign trade is carried by ship, and about 80 percent of the import/export transactions are carried out through the ports of Buenos Aires and La Plata. The waterways on the Parana and Uruguay rivers are well-dredged and maintained. These rivers link the port of Buenos Aires to internal Argentine ports, as well as to ports in Paraguay and Brazil.</p>

<h4>Air Cargo</h4>

<p><a href="http://www.tca.aero/">Terminal de Cargas Argentina (TCA)</a> was created as a concessionary partnership established by the GOA for the operation of airfreight terminals at international airports. TCA provides full logistics and storage services to all foreign cargo agents. TCA's primary business is bonded warehouse management at major Argentine international airports, where the company stores imported and exported cargo while their consignees perform relevant formalities with the General Customs Administration or <em><a href="http://www.afip.gov.ar/aduanaDefault.asp">Dirección General de Aduanas (DGA)</a></em>. TCA's headquarters are located at Ezeiza Airport (Argentina’s main international airport just outside of Buenos Aires). The company also has branches in Córdoba, Mendoza, Mar del Plata, and Jorge Newbery Domestic Airport, in Buenos Aires City. Air cargo imports have grown rapidly in the past years. International courier delivery services are extremely active and most global express delivery firms have significant operations in Argentina, including FedEx, DHL, and UPS.</p>

<h4>The Retail Network</h4>

<p>There are two types of traditional sales channels in Argentina. One is through large-scale retailers with a defined but limited share of the market. The other is through the many specialized retailers that seek to protect their niches.</p>

<p>The food retail market is loosely separated into three categories: traditional "mom and pop" stores scattered throughout local neighborhoods, self-service mini-markets and drugstores, and the supermarkets and hypermarkets. Consumers prefer hypermarkets and supermarkets for lower prices on weekly and monthly purchases.</p>

<p>Return to Top</p>

<h3>Selling Factors/Techniques</h3>

<p>The population and economic activity are highly concentrated in the Greater Buenos Aires area. The population is of largely European descent and continues to have strong ethnic, cultural, and business ties with Europe. In some respects, consumer preferences resemble those of Europeans more than those of other Latin American nationals.</p>

<p>The U.S. continues to be one of Argentina's top trading partners. Many U.S. firms have been very successful here and U.S. products have a strong reputation for quality and technological innovation. The U.S. lifestyle and consumption habits are increasingly influential.</p>

<p>As in many countries, personal relationships are fundamental when doing business in Argentina. Success requires taking the time to develop a close personal relationship with the representative, agent, or distributor. Marketing U.S. products and services in Argentina requires a higher level of research, preparation, and involvement.</p>

<p>Always use a professional translator, and if possible, have a native Argentine speaker, such as your agent or distributor, review any materials before using them in Argentina. Any official document to be presented before GOA authorities that is not in Spanish requires attachment of an official translation into Spanish by a Sworn Public Translator (<em>Traductor Público</em>), as well as certification by the Translators Association.</p>

<p>Price and financing terms have become increasingly important selling factors.</p>

<p>Some practical tips to successfully approach Argentine consumers are the following:</p>

<p>• Appoint a representative or distributor</p>

<p>• Have Spanish language capacity</p>

<p>• Furnish materials in Spanish</p>

<p>• Have a long-term outlook</p>

<p>• Personalize your approach</p>

<p>• Be consistent in attention to service and delivery</p>

<p>• Provide credit terms</p>

<p>• Dot your I's and cross your T's (i.e., consult as appropriate with lawyers and accountants)</p>

<p>• Protect your trademarks</p>

<p>• Engage in frequent visits and follow-ups</p>

<p>Return to Top</p>

<h3>Electronic Commerce</h3>

<p>The number of people with Internet access continued to grow in 2012, although at a moderate 2 percent rate. Network expansion allows people to connect from multiple locations such as offices, cyber-cafes, phone booths, etc. Over 25 million people (over half the Argentine population) were Internet users in 2011. E-commerce activity has grown tenfold since 2000 in peso terms.</p>

<p>The Argentine Government plans to call public tenders to lay 13,500 km (8,388 mi.) of cable in 2013 as part of the country's federal fiber network project “<em>Argentina Conectada</em>”. This will add to the already-installed 8,000 km (4,971 mi.) of fiber. Once the national fiber platform is fully deployed, more than 1,400 cities and localities across Argentina will have connectivity. To date, the GOA has invested more than $484 million.</p>

<p>While sales via Internet have not traditionally reached the same levels as in other countries, a study conducted by Prince &amp; Cook showed an increase of approximately 50 percent in 2011. Online purchases using credit cards represented 68.3 percent of total online transactions, up from 30 percent in 2009. This may be due to the boom experienced by discount coupon sales and a growing confidence in electronic payment sites. Online sales have also a high rate of acceptance in the interior of the country, where the variety of products available is more limited and delivery is an increasingly important sales tool.</p>

<h3>Trade Promotion and Advertising</h3>

<p>Argentina has many advertising agencies and management consultants. The leading agencies are members of the Argentine Association of Advertising Agencies (<em>Asociación Argentina de Agencias de Publicidad</em>). Many branches or affiliates of major U.S. advertising agencies are among the leading agencies. Advertising in the print media is the most widely used method, although television, internet, and radio advertising are increasingly important.</p>

<h3>Pricing</h3>

<p>U.S. exporters should take into account that locally manufactured products and those products imported from other MERCOSUR countries will have a price and duty advantage. Customized services and products can still charge price premiums demanded by the affluent population in certain geographical areas. Argentina has been traditionally characterized by high prices, high costs, and relatively low competitive pressures due to highly concentrated markets. Please refer to the “Trade Regulations and Standards” guide for more information on import tariffs.</p>

<h3>Sales Service/Customer Support</h3>

<p>Customer service is a differentiating factor when selling a product. Argentine consumers are paying increased attention to home delivery and after-sales service.</p>

<h3>Protecting Your Intellectual Property</h3>

<p>Several general principles are important for effective management of intellectual property (“IP”) rights in Argentina. First, it is important to have an overall strategy to protect your IP. Second, IP is protected differently in Argentina than in the U.S. Third, rights must be registered and enforced in Argentina, under local laws. Your U.S. trademark and patent registrations will not protect you in Argentina. There is no such thing as an “international copyright” that will automatically protect an author’s writings throughout the entire world. Protection against unauthorized use in a particular country depends on the national laws of that country. However, most countries do offer copyright protection to foreign works under certain conditions, and these conditions have been greatly simplified by international copyright treaties and conventions.</p>

<p>Registration of patents and trademarks is on a first-in-time, first-in-right basis, so you should consider applying for trademark and patent protection even before selling your products or services in Argentina. It is vital that companies understand that intellectual property is primarily a private right and that the U.S. government generally cannot enforce rights for private individuals in Argentina. It is the responsibility of the rights holders to register, protect, and enforce their rights where relevant, retaining their own counsel and advisors. Companies may wish to seek advice from local attorneys or IP consultants who are experts in Argentine law. The U.S. Commercial Service can provide a <a href="http://argentina.usembassy.gov/legal.html">list of local lawyers</a> upon request.</p>

<p>While the U.S. Government stands ready to assist, there is little we can do if the rights holders have not taken these fundamental steps necessary to securing and enforcing their IP in a timely fashion. Moreover, in many countries, rights holders who delay enforcing their rights on a mistaken belief that the USG can provide a political resolution to a legal problem may find that their rights have been eroded or abrogated due to legal doctrines such as statutes of limitations, laches, estoppel, or unreasonable delay in prosecuting a law suit. In no instance should U.S. Government advice be seen as a substitute for the obligation of a rights holder to promptly pursue its case.</p>

<p>It is always advisable to conduct due diligence on potential partners. Negotiate from the position of your partner and give your partner clear incentives to honor the contract. A good partner is an important ally in protecting IP rights. Consider carefully, however, whether to permit your partner to register your IP rights on your behalf. Doing so may create a risk that your partner will list itself as the IP owner and fail to transfer the rights should the partnership end. Keep an eye on your cost structure and reduce the margins (and the incentive) of would-be bad actors. Projects and sales in Argentina require constant attention. Work with legal counsel familiar with Argentine laws to create a solid contract that includes non-compete clauses, and confidentiality/non-disclosure provisions.</p>

<p>It is also recommended that small and medium-size companies understand the importance of working together with trade associations and organizations to support efforts to protect IP and stop counterfeiting. There are a number of these organizations, both Argentine and U.S.-based. These include:</p>

<h3>Import Tariffs</h3>

<p>The Harmonized Schedule (HS) is used to specify tariff classifications in Argentina. The HS was implemented on January 1, 1992 and is aligned with the WTO Customs Classification Code adopted in 1979. On January 1, 1995, Argentina implemented the MERCOSUR Common Nomenclature, known as the <em>Nomenclatura Común del MERCOSUR</em> (NCM), which is consistent with the U.S. Harmonized System for tariff classification.</p>

<p>Ad-valorem duties are assessed on the Cost, Insurance, and imported merchandise (at the Argentine port or airport of entry). was 16 percent.</p>

<p>Freight (CIF) value of the In 2012, the average tariff</p>

<p>Specific duties are applied to certain products and are expressed in monetary terms per unit of measurement. A combination of both ad-valorem and specific duties ("mixed duties") is used in some cases.</p>

<h4>Selected Average Tariff Rates by Type of Products</h4>

<p>According to the NCM, these are the average tariff rates for some of the Chapters:</p>

<p>Chapter 1: Live Animals; Animal Products: 2 percent ad-valorem;</p>

<p>Chapter 28: Inorganic chemicals; organic or inorganic compounds of precious metals, of rare-earth metals, of radioactive elements or of isotopes: 2 percent ad-valorem;</p>

<p>Chapter 31: Fertilizers: 5 percent ad-valorem;</p>

<p>Chapter 38: Miscellaneous chemical products: 14 percent ad-valorem;</p>

<p>Chapter 39: Plastics and articles thereof: 14 percent ad-valorem;</p>

<p>Chapter 48: Paper and paperboard; articles of paper pulp, of paper or of paperboard: 16 percent ad-valorem;</p>

<p>Chapter 49: Printed books, newspapers, pictures and other products of the printing industry; manuscripts, typescripts and plans: 0 to 16 percent ad-valorem;</p>

<p>Chapter 61: Articles of apparel and clothing accessories (knitted or crocheted): 35 percent ad-valorem;</p>

<p>Chapter 62: Articles of apparel and clothing accessories (not knitted or crocheted): 0-35 percent ad-valorem;</p>

<p>Chapter 70: Glass and glassware: 12.4 percent ad-valorem;</p>

<p>Chapter 94: Furniture; bedding, mattresses, mattress supports, cushions and similar stuffed furnishings; lamps and lighting fittings, not elsewhere specified or included; illuminated sign illuminated nameplates and the like; prefabricated buildings: 20-18 percent ad-valorem;</p>

<p>Chapter 95: Toys, games and sports requisites; parts and accessories thereof: 20 percent ad-valorem.</p>

<h4>Minimum Import Prices</h4>

<p>In May 2001, the Government of Argentina (GOA) introduced minimum import prices/reference values on several products covered by specific HS codes to avoid under-invoicing. When the minimum import price is greater than the declared value at Customs, the importer must make a deposit for taxes due on the price differential to take merchandise out of customs. This deposit will be held during the period of investigation on the real or market import price. These minimum import prices apply when goods are imported for consumption.</p>

<p>In 2005, in an attempt to continue adjusting mechanisms against tax evasion in import operations, the GOA issued Secretariat of Industry Resolutions 1907 and 1908. These regulations created a new system to determine “reference import values” (<em>valores criterio</em>) for products to be compared with the value declared at Customs by the importer, and impose stricter conditions to import when the declared unitary FOB value represents less than 80 percent of the reference value. In these cases, the import process will continue, but the importer will bear additional restrictions such as:</p>

<p>• Increase on Valued Added Tax (VAT) and Income Tax paid on imports, reaching rates of 21 percent and 11 percent respectively, depending on the product type.</p>

<p>• Loss of tax benefits such as exemption or deferment of VAT and Income Tax payments.</p>

<p>• Deposit of a guarantee equivalent of the difference between the reference value and the declared value. Deposit/guarantee policies are no longer accepted for these cases. Only cash, bank collaterals, or public debt bonds will serve as a guarantee to allow the import transaction.</p>

<p>Several subsequent regulations have continued to update and expand the list of minimum/reference prices. In 2008, Customs Notes 90 and 91 required importers of any goods from designated countries that are invoiced below the reference prices to have the invoice validated by both the foreign customs agency and the appropriate Argentine Embassy or Consulate. U.S. products with reference prices include:</p>

<p>• Matches</p>

<p>• Other plates, sheets, film, foil and strip, of plastics, non-cellular and not reinforced, laminated, supported or similarly combined with other materials: of poly (methyl methacrylate), not over 25mm or over 105mm in thickness</p>

<p>• Rubber bicycle tubes</p>

<p>• Wooden hangers</p>

<p>• Non-rewritable compact discs (CD-R)</p>

<p>• Fungicides</p>

<p>• Electrical terminals</p>

<p>• Low density polyethylene</p>

<p>• Cermet manufactures</p>

<p>• Fiberglass tissue</p>

<p>• Iron and Steel tubes</p>

<p>• Tires (new)</p>

<p>• Refrigerators</p>

<p>• Washing machines</p>

<p>At the same time, the Argentine Customs Bureau announced that there would be specific Customs checkpoints that will control imports of certain product categories such as household appliances, electronic devices, motorcycles, textiles, apparel, footwear and toys. These items are traditionally the most affected by import restrictions.</p>

<p>Return to Top</p>

<h3>Trade Barriers</h3>

<p>The basic legislation affecting import and export transactions is contained in the Customs Code (Law 22,415), which came into force in September 1981. In 2010, MERCOSUR approved the so called MERCOSUR Customs Code to come into effect January 1, 2012, which now needs the approval of the Legislative branches of each of the four members.</p>

<p>In 2006, there was a significant increase in the regulation of goods and capital flows. The most significant changes include product-specific export restrictions; variations in tariffs on key export commodities; the extension of an Argentina/Brazil automotive managed trade regime that was due to expire in 2006; the implementation of government-promoted private sector agreements to limit intra-MERCOSUR trade in sensitive sectors, including textiles and shoes, and more extensive regulations on capital movement.</p>

<p>While there is no legal prohibition against foreign companies repatriating profits, GOA regulations implemented in November 2011 mandating that firms receive permission from Argentine Tax and Customs Authority (AFIP) in order to exchange local currency into foreign exchange, serve as a de-facto control on the ability of foreign firms to repatriate profits. Meanwhile, export proceeds must be repatriated to Argentina. Repatriation deadlines vary based on product categories. These stipulations could change based on economic conditions.</p>

<p>Companies located in Argentina wishing to import must be registered in the National Registry of Importers and Exporters. Registration is free of charge and procedures are relatively simple.</p>

<h4>Antidumping and Countervailing Measures</h4>

<p>Regulations define "dumping" as the export price of imported merchandise being lower than the comparable sales price in normal commercial operations of identical or similar goods destined for consumption in the domestic market of the country of origin. Argentina has set antidumping and countervailing measures on various occasions, some of which still remain in force.</p>

<p>Imported goods for consumption that benefit from a subsidy abroad may be subject to a compensatory duty when they cause, or threaten to cause, serious damage to a local industry. Argentine fair trade laws are based on Article VI of the WTO under Resolutions 281/97 and 622/95.</p>

<h4>Tariff Barriers</h4>

<p>MERCOSUR, created in 1991, gradually eliminated almost all non-tariff restrictions and other limitations to trade among its founding members (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay). As of 2006, over 99 percent of all MERCOSUR tariff lines had been reduced to zero. Sugar has not yet been incorporated into MERCOSUR’s internal free trade regime, and certain other products such as autos and auto parts, while officially incorporated, are actively managed, including by the use of quantitative restrictions (quotas).</p>

<p>For countries outside the MERCOSUR area, Argentina and its MERCOSUR partners established the MERCOSUR Common External Tariff (CET) on January 1, 1995. The CET currently ranges from zero to 20 percent for most products. However, some products in the automotive sector can reach 35 percent.</p>

<p>There is a list of sensitive products temporarily exempted from the CET. The first group includes very sensitive products such as Information Technology and Capital Goods. At the same time, the MERCOSUR countries can set an import duty different from the CET until December 31, 2015 for specific products, using the so-called Exceptions List (pursuant to Decision 58/10 CMC MERCOSUR).</p>

<p>Starting in July 2012, imported capital goods that compete against local production have been subject to a 14 percent tariff. Imported capital goods that don't have a local substitute face a 2 percent tariff.</p>

<p>Information and telecommunications-related (IT) products are regulated by a separate tariff schedule, which expires on December 31, 2015. After this date, all import duties will begin to converge among MERCOSUR members according to a fixed schedule. Some goods not produced within MERCOSUR, such as newsprint, books, and certain petroleum products, pay 0 to 16 percent import duties.</p>

<p>The tariffs on imports apply to the declared CIF value in Argentina. In addition to the tariffs, the following fees and taxes apply:</p>

<p>• 0.5 percent statistics fee on the CIF value, with some exceptions. This fee is not levied on MERCOSUR intra-zone trade.</p>

<p>• 21 or 10.5 percent (depending on the product) of Value Added Tax (VAT) on the CIF value plus tariff and statistics fees.</p>

<p>• 20 or 10 percent (depending on the product) of advanced VAT on CIF plus tariff and statistics fees on all goods imported for resale. Goods imported directly by end-users are exempted.</p>

<p>• Six percent profits tax on all retail goods, except for goods imported directly by users. Individuals pay 11 percent.</p>

<p>• 1.5 percent gross income tax</p>

<p>The CIF value plus the duty and the import statistics fee form the base for the application of domestic taxes. For this reason, foreign supplier's invoice must support the imports. VAT and Profits Tax are deductible from gross income tax.</p>

<p>Domestic taxes (i.e., excise taxes) are levied on tobacco, alcoholic beverages, soft drinks, syrups, extracts and concentrates, television sets, tape recorders, record players, and microwave appliances, among other products. Excise taxes are paid on the basis of sworn returns or through stamps affixed to the product. Rates vary considerably, reaching up to 60 percent of the retail price for cigarettes.</p>

<p>Decree 690/2002 specifies exceptions to the payment of the statistics fee, which include:</p>

<p>• Certain imported goods for animal or vegetable reproduction, which pay a zero percent CET.</p>

<p>• Certain imported mineral products that pay zero percent CET.</p>

<p>• Imported books, brochures, and newsprint.</p>

<p>• New imported capital and IT-related goods.</p>

<p>• Goods imported under the temporary import regime.</p>

<h4>Non-Tariff Barriers</h4>

<p>As of February 1, 2012, prior approval from the AFIP is required for all imports. Applications are submitted via the AFIP online system “MARIA” which is accessible to Customs Brokers through the submission of a Sworn Affidavit of Intent to Import (DJAI). Approval times and criteria applied to determine if permission is granted to import are unpredictable and exporters are advised to ensure that Argentine clients have an approved DJAI as well as permission from AFIP to purchase the foreign exchange necessary to pay for goods prior to shipping. Moreover, certain types of goods may only be imported into Argentina with a permit from the pertinent authority. In addition, government officials have used phytosanitary rules, safeguard measures involving specific duties, anti-dumping investigations, and other practices to inhibit imports and protect domestic industry. Argentina continues to delay issuance of health certificates that would allow the resumption of exports of poultry meat and products from the United States. It imposes a number of trade restrictions, including safeguard provisions on Brazilian color televisions and anti-dumping duties on imports of U.S. polyvinyl chloride.</p>

<p>Prior government approval is required for imports of sensitive goods such as pharmaceuticals, foodstuffs, insecticides, veterinary products, medical devices, defense materials, cosmetics and toiletries, and other products. Many such products are subject to registration and presentation of a sanitary certificate issued by a competent authority in the exporting country, or other requisites to protect human, animal or plant health. Certain types of special vehicles, publications, shoes, carpets, paper and automobiles to be used as prototypes require prior government approval to be imported into Argentina.</p>

<p>Many food-related and agricultural imports, such as livestock, plants, bulbs, cuttings, rhizomes, roots, grains, and plant products require a sanitary certificate issued by a competent authority in the exporting country. Products destined for human consumption must fulfill certain specifications and be labeled and packed accordingly.</p>

<h4>Quotas</h4>

<p>There is a quota system and special regime for auto parts. The bilateral auto agreement between Argentina and Brazil establishes preferential market access treatment for both countries to protect the MERCOSUR automobile industry. A complicated system of reciprocal obligations exists between Argentina and Brazil. Currently, there is a trade-balancing scheme that determines import levels for auto assemblers. The Argentine government separately sets annual quotas for official distributors of foreign cars and auto dealers, as well as for other firms and individuals. Foreign auto manufacturers (including U.S. firms) in MERCOSUR countries receive national treatment.</p>

<p>In addition, temporary quotas exist on organic chemicals (HS code 2915.90), fluoride of aluminum (2826.12), and petroleum resins (3911.10) affecting U.S. exports.</p>

<p>Return to Top</p>

<h3>Import Requirements and Documentation</h3>

<h4>Permission to Import</h4>

<p>Since February 1, 2012, Argentina requires that all importers must request and receive approval from the AFIP prior to importing products from abroad. This sworn affidavit of intention to import (or the DJAI) is required for each import transaction and is reviewed by AFIP. Processing time is officially 15 days, but many requests are put on hold for indefinite periods of review. An Argentine firm or individual who wishes to import must utilize the services of an Argentine customs broker to file the DJAI through the online Custom’s system known as MARIA if they do not possess a customs brokerage license to handle their own imports. The requested merchandise must arrive in Argentina within 180 days of the DJAI being marked “Salida” by AFIP to signify approval to import. Follow this link for additional information on the DJAI process: <a href="http://www.buyusainfo.net/docs/x_9655141.pdf">http://www.buyusainfo.net/docs/x_9655141.pdf</a>.</p>

<h4>Non-Automatic Licenses</h4>

<p>The GOA recently abolished the non-automatic import license requirements for products to be imported into Argentina. Given that the new Permission to Import regime is applied to each shipment of all products and has a similar spirit to that of Non-Automatic Licenses, the Argentine Government decided to remove the non-automatic import license as a prerequisite to import the majority of products that required it.</p>

<h4>Documentation Requirements and Restrictions</h4>

<p>In 1997, the Argentine government put in place greater certificate of origin and consularization requirements on a broad range of imports generally covering but not limited to consumer goods, textiles, apparel and footwear, printing machines, and machine tools. Moreover, on March 27, 2012 AFIP issued Resolution 3304 regarding new inspection and documentation procedures for imported goods arriving in Argentina. Given the extensive manpower and inspections infrastructure required to actually implement Resolution 3304, it is still unclear as to which requirements and procedures will be implemented and how. Given the aforementioned and the significant number of changes in requirements to import goods into Argentina over the last year, it is strongly advised that all exporters confer with a Freight Forwarder, with an established local partner, or directly with an Argentine Customs Broker prior to shipping goods to Argentina. In addition, it is recommended that exporters consult the U.S. Commercial Service in Argentina’s website at <a href="http://export.gov/argentina/">http://export.gov/argentina/</a> for information on new export and customs requirements.</p>

<h4>Import/Export Documentation</h4>

<h4>Maritime Shipments</h4>

<p>The following documents are required for all maritime shipments, regardless of value:</p>

<p>• Commercial invoice (original and three copies)</p>

<p>• Bill of lading (minimum of one negotiable copy for customs purposes)</p>

<p>• Packing list (not generally required for bulk commodities or for articles that are identical in kind, characteristics, composition, weight, etc.)
• Insurance certificate (if insurance coverage is purchased by the exporter)</p>

<h4>Air Cargo Shipments</h4>

<p>These documents are always required for air cargo shipments, regardless of value:</p>

<p>• Commercial invoice (original and three copies)</p>

<p>• Airway bill (number of copies depends on requirements of the importer and on the airline used)
• Packing list.</p>

<p>Freight forwarding and/or agents' fees cannot be shown on airway bills on a freight collect basis; i.e. the fees must be prepaid.</p>

<h4>Commercial Invoices</h4>

<p>Commercial invoices must be presented in Spanish (one original and three copies), with the caption "Original Invoice." Carbon copies, printed copies, or photocopied invoices will not be accepted in place of the original. In addition, a properly authorized member of the firm must provide an original signature in ink on each copy of the invoice presented (i.e., the original and three copies).</p>

<p>The invoice should contain:</p>

<p>• Invoice number</p>

<p>• Place and date of execution</p>

<p>• Full name and address of the exporter</p>

<p>• Full name and address of consignee and name and address of the agent (freight forwarder), if any
• Quantity, indicating measuring units invoiced</p>

<p>• Name and description of goods (in Spanish)</p>

<p>• Unit price and total</p>

<p>• Currency used in transaction</p>

<p>• Terms of payment and delivery, using INCOTERMS</p>

<p>• Origin and place/port of export of the merchandise</p>

<p>• Means of transport (specifying via ocean or air or parcel post)</p>

<p>• Port or place of entry into Argentina</p>

<p>If the invoice is in English, the common practice is to show the Spanish translation just below the English text.</p>

<p>The invoice must contain the following declaration in Spanish:</p>

<p><em>"DECLARO BAJO JURAMENTO QUE LOS PRECIOS CONSIGNADOS EN ESTA FACTURA COMERCIAL SON LOS REALMENTE PAGADOS O A PAGARSE, Y QUE NO EXISTE CONVENIO ALGUNO QUE PERMITA SU ALTERACION, Y QUE TODOS LOS DATOS REFERENTES A LA CALIDAD, CANTIDAD, VALOR, PRECIOS, ETC., Y DESCRIPCION DE LA MERCADERIA CONCUERDAN EN TODAS SUS PARTES CON LO DECLARADO EN LA CORRESPONDIENTE SHIPPER'S EXPORT DECLARATION."</em></p>

<p>(<em>Unofficial Translation</em>: "I swear under oath that the prices on this commercial invoice are those really paid or to be paid, and that no agreement exists that permits their modification, and that all data pertaining to quality, quantity, value, prices, etc., and description of the merchandise agree in all their parts with what was declared in the corresponding Shipper's Export Declaration.")</p>

<p>A fax of the commercial invoice may be used as a working copy for customs, but the original must be presented in order to complete entry.</p>

<h4>Bill of Lading</h4>

<p>The bill of lading should be issued (at minimum) in one negotiable copy; additional negotiable copies may be required by the importer, bank, steamship line, or other interested party (follow instructions from the importer or those given in the letter of credit or other contractual arrangement). Bills of lading must indicate the weight and volume of each package, as well as the total weight and volume of the shipment. All bills of lading must also show the amount of freight and a statement "Freight Paid," or "Freight Payable at Destination" as appropriate.</p>

<p>The bill of lading must show the following:</p>

<p>• Name of the ship</p>

<p>• Name of the ship's captain</p>

<p>• Port of registry and registered tonnage (weight and volume)</p>

<p>• Name of the charter or the shipper</p>

<p>• Name of the consignee (unless it is "to the bearer" or "to order")</p>

<p>• Number of packages, and specific description of the contents, the quantity, quality and marks of the goods</p>

<p>• Port of loading and unloading, with a declaration of the port of call, if any</p>

<p>• Freight amount</p>

<p>• Place, method and date of payment</p>

<p>• Date of preparation of the document and signature of the captain and of the shipper (signature of the shipping company and shipper should be signed manually, facsimile signatures are not acceptable)</p>

<p>• Container and seal number, and terms of shipment</p>

<p>• Invoice number suggested</p>

<h4>Packing Lists</h4>

<p>Packing lists are necessary for customs clearance in Argentina and must describe the contents of each package. Where the contents of a parcel are the same as those in other parcels of the same lot, one description on the packing list covering the lot will be sufficient. The packing list preferably should be in Spanish. No packing list is necessary for goods imported in bulk, such as coal, petroleum, sand, etc., or for articles identical in kind, characteristics, composition, weight, etc. It is suggested that the packing list be included in every air shipment.</p>

<h4>Insurance Certificate</h4>

<p>The U.S. exporter needs to be concerned about this document when purchasing insurance and should act according to the details provided by the importer. Marine insurance can be obtained from any insurance company.</p>

<h4>Certificate of Origin</h4>

<p>The certificate of origin is a document required by Argentine Customs under various circumstances:</p>

<p><em>Control of Preferential Origin</em></p>

<p>To claim preferential import duties when the country of origin has signed a trade agreement endorsing these preferences, as is the case of imports from member countries of MERCOSUR or the Latin American Integration Association (ALADI). The Argentine Customs authorities will require this document to grant preferential treatment at the importer’s request.</p>

<p><em>Control of Non-Preferential Origin</em></p>

<p>The government of Argentina also requires a certificate of origin for certain products, such as textiles and footwear, regardless of their country of origin (Resolution MEOSP 39/96).</p>

<p>This control is in place to address import issues such as:</p>

<p>• Antidumping Duties</p>

<p>• Countervailing Measures</p>

<p>• Safeguard Measures</p>

<p>• Import Quotas</p>

<p>• Trade Statistics</p>

<p>The certificate of origin requires the authorized signature of the local Chamber of Commerce Secretary in the U.S. and the seal of that organization and also must be legalized by the Argentine consulate in the U.S. Note that if the product to be shipped contains components material manufactured in another country, the U.S. company must obtain signatures of the relevant chambers in those countries and have the document legalized by the Argentine consulates in those countries.</p>

<h3>U.S. Export Controls</h3>

<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) is responsible for implementing and enforcing the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), which regulates the export and re-export of most commercial items. The items that BIS regulates are often referred to as “dual use” since they have both commercial and military applications. Please note that even commercial items without an obvious military use may be subject to the EAR. Items with an Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) that are regulated for Chemical and Biological Weapons (CB), National Security (NS), Missile Technology (MT), Regional Stability (RS) or Crime Control (Column 1 or 2) purposes require a license from BIS for export to Russia.</p>

<p>Further information on export controls is available at: <a href="http://www.bis.doc.gov/licensing/exportingbasics.htm">http://www.bis.doc.gov/licensing/exportingbasics.htm</a>.</p>

<p>BIS has developed a list of "red flags", or warning signs, intended to discover possible violations of the EAR. These are posted at:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/enforcement/oee/compliance/23-compliance-a-training/51-red-flag-indicators">http://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/enforcement/oee/compliance/23-compliance-a-training/51-red-flag-indicators</a></p>

<p>Also, BIS has "Know Your Customer" guidance at:</p>

<p>If there is reason to believe a violation is taking place or has occurred, report it to the Department of Commerce by calling the 24-hour hotline at 1(800) 424-2980, or via the confidential lead page at: <a href="https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/component/rsform/form/14-reporting-violations-form?task=forms.edit">https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/component/rsform/form/14-reporting-violations-form?task=forms.edit</a>. The EAR does not control all goods, services, and technologies. Other U.S. Government agencies regulate more specialized exports. For example, the U.S. Department of State has authority over defense articles and defense services. A list of other agencies involved in export control can be found on the BIS web site or in Supplement No. 3 to Part 730 of the EAR, which is available on the Government Printing Office Web site at <a href="http://www.access.gpo.gov/bis/ear/ear_data.html">http://www.access.gpo.gov/bis/ear/ear_data.html</a>.</p>

<h3>Labeling and Marking Requirements</h3>

<p>Under Argentine law 22,802/83, the Bureau of Trade Regulation (<em>Dirección de Lealtad Comercial</em>) of the Ministry of Economy’s Secretariat of Industry, establishes labeling requirements for products in Argentina. The law requires that product labels bear all the information that the customer needs, and that the information is true and valid. The Secretariat of Industry in the Ministry of Economy ensures transparency in all business transactions and enforces the labeling regime.</p>

<p>Law 22,802 of 1983, known as the Merchandise Marking Act, supersedes Law 11,275 of 1923. The current law states the general and basic labeling requirements for domestic or imported products, as follows:</p>

<p>Article 1: - All packaged products sold in Argentina will bear the following information on a printed label in a visible manner on the package or container:</p>

<p>a)  Name (description of product)</p>

<p>b)  Country of origin</p>

<p>c)  Quality, purity, or blending description</p>

<p>d)  Net weight</p>

<p>All non-packaged products commercialized in country will have to comply with requirements a), b) and c), as stated above.</p>

<p>For further inquiries, please contact:</p>

<p>Subsecretaría del Consumidor</p>

<p>Secretaría de Comercio Interior</p>

<p>Ministerio de Economía y Finanzas Públicas</p>

<p>Av. Pres. Gral. Julio A. Roca 651</p>

<p>C1067ABB Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires</p>

<p>In some cases, the Government Regulatory bodies of each industry provide information on the corresponding labeling requirements.</p>

<p>For example, for information on labeling requirements for the medical industry, hygiene and food products etc., the ANMAT (the equivalent of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the regulatory body of the Ministry of Health) provides additional information to the general rules for specific products.</p>

<p>Administración Nacional de Medicamentos, Alimentos y Tecnología Médica (<em>ANMAT</em>) <a href="http://www.anmat.gob.ar">http://www.anmat.gob.ar</a>; <a href="http://www.anmat.gob.ar/principal_en.asp">http://www.anmat.gob.ar/principal_en.asp</a></p>

<h3>Prohibited and Restricted Imports</h3>

<ul>
<li>Prohibited Imports</li>
<li>Used Capital Goods</li>
</ul>


<h4>Prohibited Imports</h4>

<p>The Government of Argentina has prohibited importation of the following products:</p>

<p>• Toys and childcare products containing high concentration of phthalates (Resolution 583/2008, Ministry of Health)
• Medical products containing nimesulide as an active ingredient (Disposition 4430/2009 ANMAT).
• Incandescent light bulbs for residential use included under HS Code 8539.22.00, with the exception of those of power equal to or less than 25 watts, and those of voltage equal or less than 50 volts (Law 26473).</p>

<p>• Certain used machinery, equipment, instruments, devices, and its parts (Resolution 909/1994 MEOSP and its modifications: Resolution 748/1995, Decree 690/2002, Appendix XIV; Resolution 89/2003 ME, article 7°, etc.).</p>

<p>• Medicines and food containing olaquindox (Resolution 84/2007 SENASA).</p>

<p>• Paints, lacquers and varnishes containing more than 0.06 grams of lead for every 100 grams of non-volatile mass (Resolution 7/2009 MoH).
• Used automobiles (Decree 110/1999)</p>

<p>• Used motorcycles and velocipedes (Resolution 790/1992, Ministry of Economy)</p>

<p>• Used clothing and accessories (MERCOSUR Tariff Codes 6309.00.10 &amp; 6309.00.90) until January 1, 2016. (Decree 2112/2010)
• Telephone terminals that operate in a band between 1880 Mghz-1900 Mghz (Resolution SC 1994/1999)
• Used and recapped tires (MERCOSUR Tariff Codes 4012.10.00 &amp; 4012.20.00, Law 25,626)
• Raw cotton (not carded or combed, harsh or rough) as per Res. SENASA 208/2003</p>

<p>• All types of dangerous residues (Law 24051)</p>

<p>• Certain dangerous substances (Resolutions 750/2000, 845/2000, 182/1999, etc.)</p>

<p>Additionally, ANMAT regulates and prohibits imports of certain toxic substances contained in products such as pharmaceutical products and cosmetics. The National Service of Agricultural Food Health and Quality (SENASA), provides information on import regulations for agricultural products.</p>

<p>Argentina bans imports of live ruminants and their meat due to Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) concerns according to Resolution 799/2010 that replaces former Resolution 117/2002 an its amendments. Resolution 799/2010 defines the methodology to be followed for the risk assessment of importation of live animals, their reproductive material, and products and by-products of animal origin in relation to BSE occurrence.</p>

<p>Sweetbreads (thymus) were the highest valued and most competitive U.S. beef product exported to Argentina that was affected by the BSE beef ban. The trade constraint regarding the thymus sweetbread is an Argentine requirement that classifies thymus sweetbreads as high risk for BSE. SENASA published a draft regulation for comment in January 2010 that will amend 117/2002 and will require a risk assessment before allowing imports of sweetbreads and other animal products.</p>

<p>For additional information on animal products, please contact the U.S. Foreign Agricultural Service in Argentina at <a href="Andrea.Yankelevich@usda.gov">Andrea.Yankelevich@usda.gov</a>.</p>

<h4>Used Capital Goods</h4>

<p>The Government of Argentina places restrictions on imports of used products to facilitate market entry of new machines or equipment. This limitation applies to many products, including used medical equipment, used vehicles, remanufactured parts, tires, boats, etc. In some specific cases, there are exceptions; e.g., mining machinery.</p>

<p>The following conditions must be met: the equipment must be refurbished (repaired or remanufactured) by the manufacturer in the country of origin, or in Argentina. The goods must be imported by the final user.</p>

<h3>Customs Regulations and Contact Information</h3>

<p>At a national level, the General Customs Bureau (DGA) applies, collects, and controls taxes under the Argentine Customs Code. Additionally, it regulates other taxes on import and export transactions on behalf of other entities. In general, the DGA applies and controls import and export transactions.</p>

<p>The DGA is part of the AFIP. AFIP is an autonomous authority at the administrative level, under the general supervision and legal control of the Ministry of Economy. It executes the tax and customs policies set by the Executive Branch.</p>

<h4>Overview</h4>

<p>A 1994 decree created the legal framework (Decree 1474/94) for standards-related activities in Argentina.</p>

<p>As a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), Argentina signed the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT), affirming its obligations relative to technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures. The Argentine Standards Institute (IRAM) has signed the WTO TBT Code of Good Practice for the Preparation, Adoption and Application of Standards. Responsibilities under the TBT agreement include the establishment of a national inquiry point to serve as a central location for information on standards-related issues, including proposed mandatory regulations. The Argentine inquiry point is in the Secretariat of Industry (see Information Sources below). The U.S. inquiry point is the <a href="http://www.nist.gov/director/sco/ncsci/">National Center for Standards and Certification Information (NCSCI)</a>, located at National Institute of Standards and Technology (see Information Sources below).</p>

<p><strong>Standards and Regulations in MERCOSUR</strong></p>

<p>Argentina, as an active MERCOSUR member, participates in the development of MERCOSUR standards and regulations. The MERCOSUR Standards Association, Asociación MERCOSUR de Normalización, previously known as the <em>Comité MERCOSUR de Normalización</em> (AMN) ― composed of the standards institutes of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay ― develops and harmonizes standards. The Executive Secretariat of the AMN is located in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Voluntary standards are developed in 16 technical committees and deal mostly with steel products, cement and concrete, and electrical safety. Several hundred standards are at different stages of preparation or in the work plan. Venezuela will participate in this activity, as well, as a full member of MERCOSUR.</p>

<p>Regional technical regulations are developed and/or harmonized by the MERCOSUR governments in Sub Working Group 3 in the following fields: automotive, foods, metrology, safety issues for electrical products, toys, and pre-measured products. Separate working groups, such as those on telecommunications and health issues, also focus on mandatory technical requirements for their particular sectors. Approved MERCOSUR regulations are not automatically applicable in each country. To be applicable, harmonized MERCOSUR regulations must be adopted by each country. The four countries generally adopt all MERCOSUR regulations, though at different speeds.</p>

<p><strong>Agricultural and Health-related Products</strong></p>

<p>Please note that agricultural and health-related products are subject to specific and different voluntary standards and mandatory technical regulations. Medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and foods are the purview of ANMAT.</p>

<p>Return to Top</p>

<h4>Standards Organizations</h4>

<p>There are two private sector organizations that work under the National System for Standards, Quality and Certification (IRAM). IRAM is the official national standards body for the Republic of Argentina. The Argentine Accreditation Organization (OAA) is the accreditation body. These are the only organizations that carry out standardization and accreditation in Argentina. As of May 2013 there are Mutual Recognition Agreements between major foreign certification organizations and IRAM. However, it is recommended that exporters check the current status of these agreements prior to initiating new business arrangements or significant shipments of goods that require IRAM certification.</p>

<p><strong>NIST Notify U.S. Service</strong></p>

<p>Member countries of the World Trade Organization (WTO) are required under the TBT Agreement to report to the WTO all proposed technical regulations that could affect trade with other member countries. Notify U.S. is a free, web-based e-mail subscription service that offers an opportunity to review and comment on proposed foreign technical regulations that can affect your access to international markets. Register online at Internet URL: <a href="http://www.nist.gov/notifyus/">http://www.nist.gov/notifyus/</a></p>

<p>Return to Top</p>

<h4>Conformity Assessment</h4>

<p>IRAM, created in 1935, is the only developer of national voluntary standards in Argentina. Reliance on international standards as a basis for developing national standards continues to be a strong trend in Argentina. While many IRAM standards are compatible with U.S. standards, many others are patterned after requirements of various European countries and may place U.S. products at a significant disadvantage.</p>

<p>IRAM is also a certification organization, both for products and systems. Its product certification mark, the "<em>Sello IRAM</em>" is widely recognized in the country as indicating conformity to an IRAM voluntary standard. See below for the mandatory safety mark.</p>

<p>In Argentina, most standards are voluntary. The buyer and seller share responsibility in determining what product standard is applicable. Products conforming to U.S. standards may or may not be acceptable. Reflecting long-standing tradition and practice, products that meet European requirements are often preferred. This preference may be expressed in procurement specifications, in customary design and construction practices, or as market issues.</p>

<p>Given the growing importance of standards and conformity assessment in expanding U.S. exports, a standards expert is assigned to work in the U.S. Commercial Service office at the U.S. Embassy in Brasilia, with regional responsibilities for South American countries, including Argentina.</p>

<p>Return to Top</p>

<h3>Product Certification</h3>

<h4>Mandatory Testing and Mandatory Product Certification</h4>

<p>Regulated products must display an official safety "S" mark to show they conform to the regulations. However, as described above and due to implementation issues, it is difficult to state with certainty at this time the products that must be tested, certified, and marked as required by the resolutions.</p>

<h4>Non-Mandatory Testing and Product Certification</h4>

<p>There is no legal mandate to retest non-regulated products that have been approved in their country of origin. For non-regulated products, some U.S. trademarks and product certifications are well known and accepted in Argentina. As with standards, any certification that may be required for non-regulated sectors is a contractual matter to be decided between the buyer and the seller. However, it is important to be aware that market conditions and preferences may impose the use of particular standards, certification, or trademarks.</p>

<p>Traditionally, product certification in Argentina has been mostly voluntary with few active organizations, including IRAM. However, this has changed due to the partial implementation of regulations that mandate product certification. A number of U.S. certification bodies are now active in Argentina, along with several multinationals and new local entities.</p>

<p>INTI is a government agency that participates in standards development and performs product testing and certification. Due to the continuing shortage of independent laboratories in Argentina, INTI is viewed as a prime testing and calibration laboratory for the country.</p>

<p>INTI's position attracts interest and substantial technical support and cooperation from foreign countries, most notably Germany, Japan, and the U.K. These, and other countries such as France, regularly offer scholarships for long- and medium-term training courses abroad. Other Argentine private and public organizations also benefit from third country largesse.</p>

<p>To facilitate acceptance of U.S. products in the Argentine market, agreements between U.S. and local certifiers and testing houses are encouraged. This could provide recognition of existing certifications. Also, there is no impediment for U.S. certification organizations to be established and accredited in Argentina.</p>

<p>The GOA, specifically the Dirección de Lealtad Comercial office, introduced a change in the certification rules. All certification bodies that issue S-Mark certificates through recognition of testing done outside of Argentina now have to perform “accreditation of coincidence between the product intended to be marketed in Argentina and the one contained in the certificate issued abroad” and issue an official notification to that effect. The measure means having the distributor import a sample for a visual inspection before issuing the certificate or extension to the importer. This applies to all electrical products (under the scope of resolution 92/98). In fact, this requirement is now mandatory for all electrical products regardless if they belong to the same “family” of products; in the past they were exempted from this inspection. In addition, the “visual inspection” is now required to be coordinated by the laboratory, inviting an officer from Lealtad Comercial to the importer’s warehouse. Please note that this new requirement may change so for further information please contact <a href="Marina.Millet@trade.gov">Marina.Millet@trade.gov</a>.</p>

<h3>Accreditation</h3>

<p>Entities that engage in certification for regulated products must be accredited by the OAA and recognized by the Argentine Government. Testing laboratories must similarly be accredited and recognized.</p>

<p>Return to Top</p>

<h3>Publication of Technical Regulations</h3>

<p>In 1998, the GOA embarked on a path of issuing regulations mandating that certain products met safety requirements. The trend has slowed down considerably and, generally, implementation schedules have been postponed.</p>

<p>Low voltage electrical equipment was the first product category subjected to safety regulations and mandatory certification (Resolution 92/98). Regulations have also been issued for toys, shoes, gas appliances and products, construction steel, elevators, energy consumption and noise labeling of appliances, closures for dangerous products, and personal protective equipment. Since the end of 1999, efforts have been concentrated in implementation rather than in adding new categories of products to safety regulations. Full-phased implementation of most regulations is not following original schedules.</p>

<p>Resolution 92/98 originally covered all low voltage electrical equipment, but subsequent modifications have excluded various categories of products. However, the vast majority of electrical and electronic products in the consumer marketplace are still subject to this regulation. Evidence of compliance with the regulation is mandatory through product certification. Resolution 92/98 provided for a three-phased implementation, with different dates depending on the product. Phase 1 calls for a sworn declaration of conformity, phase 2 provides for a type-certification, and phase 3 requires full third-party certification with mark of conformity.</p>

<h3>Trade Agreements</h3>

<h4>ALADI</h4>

<p>Argentina is a founding member of the Association for Latin American Integration (ALADI), which was created with the long-term goal of establishing a Latin American Common Market. Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela are also founding members; Cuba attained full membership in 1999. Under the ALADI, member countries sign regional and bilateral agreements that allow partial trade liberalization that can then be extended to other members. In the 25 years since its creation, Argentina has signed several regional, multilateral and bilateral arrangements. The Internet address for ALADI is: <a href="http://www.aladi.org/nsfweb/sitioIng/">http://www.aladi.org/nsfweb/sitioIng/</a>.</p>

<h4>MERCOSUR</h4>

<p>Argentina is a member of the Common Market of the South (MERCOSUR), which entered into force in January 1991. MERCOSUR members originally included Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela joined the pact as associate members. By 1995, about 75 percent of tariff categories were included in the Common External Tariff (CET) and the remaining categories will be phased-in by 2015. MERCOSUR represents 70 percent of the South American territory and 64 percent of its population. The Internet address is as follows: <a href="http://www.mercosur.int/">http://www.mercosur.int/</a>.</p>

<h4>MERCOSUR negotiations with other economic blocs and countries:</h4>

<p>MERCOSUR-European Union</p>

<p>The two blocs had made the commitment of reaching an agreement on the process of integration by October 2004, but several differences between the blocs impeded final negotiations. These are broad and include goods, services, investments, government procurement, and intellectual property rights, among other issues.</p>

<p>MERCOSUR-Andean Community of Nations</p>

<p>(Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela)</p>

<p>The agreement took place in October 2004 and contemplates the liberalization of 80 percent of trade between the blocs within the next ten years, beginning in 2005.</p>

<p><em>MERCOSUR-Venezuela</em></p>

<p>In July 2006, MERCOSUR members accepted Venezuela’s request to become a MERCOSUR full member, which it did during 2012. Venezuela must adapt to MERCOSUR Common External Tariff scheme within a four-year timeframe, and will gradually lose its benefits from being part of the Andean Community of Nations.
MERCOSUR-Mexico</p>

<p>In July 2004, Mexico was accepted by MERCOSUR as an “observer country” within the bloc, with a view to its inclusion as associate member.</p>

<h1>Chapter 5: Investment Climate in Argentina</h1>

<p>Although the country hosts 500 U.S. companies that employ more than 155,000 Argentines, the Government of Argentina (GOA) has taken actions in recent years that have dampened the investment climate and made the business environment challenging, especially for new entrants to the market. The GOA has signaled its desire to see continued foreign direct investment (FDI) flows to enhance the nation’s productive capacity and GDP growth potential, but longstanding concerns regarding the stability of contractual rights and the regulatory environment diminish the attractiveness of prospective investments in some sectors. GOA actions to curb the remittance of profits abroad have also led some foreign companies to question whether their money should be invested in the country if they are unable to access it later. Currency controls delay companies’ access to dollars to pay suppliers. The GOA introduced an all-encompassing import licensing system that has made importing the materials necessary for day-to-day operations burdensome. Factories and distributors occasionally sit idle while the GOA delays granting approval to move inputs through customs, a process that can be restrictive and unpredictable. Companies have reported being unable to import to Argentina unless they have a trade balancing plan on file that puts them on a path to ensuring they bring in as much foreign exchange into Argentina as they take out. The GOA has not complied with its obligations under the Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) or the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (ICSID Convention) to pay final and binding arbitral awards rendered in investor-state arbitration under the BIT.</p>

<p>Following an economic crash in 2002 and the then-largest sovereign default in history, real GDP began to recover and grew at an average rate of 7.2 percent between 2003 and 2011. Growth has lately stalled; private analysts estimate Argentine GDP growth in 2012 was 1.4 percent (official figures are not considered reliable). High growth since 2003 has led to a recovery in key socio-economic indicators which had been buffeted by the 2002 crisis, including a reduction in unemployment from 21.5 percent in 2002 to 7.6 percent during the third quarter of 2012, according to official figures. In December 2012, Central Bank reserves were about USD 43 billion, up from a low of USD 9 billion in 2002. However, they were down from a high of over USD 52 billion at the end of 2010 due to being used to service debt, maintain the exchange rate, and meet other balance of payment needs. Many economic indicators ― with the notable exception of high inflation ― are still positive, though 2012 saw lower economic growth and a decline in investment.</p>

<p><strong>For these reasons we encourage U.S. companies interested in investing in Argentina to thoroughly read the in-depth report on Investment Climate published</strong> <a href="http://www.state.gov/e/eb/rls/othr/ics/2013/204592.htm">here</a> and to<a href="http://export.gov/argentina/contactus/index.asp">contact us</a> for more information.</p>

</ul>


<h3>How Do I Get Paid? (Methods of Payment)</h3>

<p>Letters of credit (L/Cs) may be used to pay for U.S. exports to Argentina. A number of banks in Argentina open L/Cs once the bank has approved a line of credit for the Argentine company. Multinationals, large, and medium sized firms are still the main users of L/Cs, although small firms use them to a lesser degree.</p>

<p>Another payment option is direct payment from the Argentine importers’ overseas bank account, but given the current regulatory framework governing trade and foreign exchange, the use of overseas accounts may not be the preferred means of payment by the Argentine importer. Bank drafts and documentary collections are commonly used. While they do help safeguard the U.S. exporter's title to goods until payment has been received, all credit and country risk remains with the exporter. There is no obligation for the bank to cover these risks. However, documentary collections are less costly than L/Cs and, where the exporter is comfortable with these risks; they offer a practical and efficient solution, particularly for Argentine subsidiaries of U.S. companies.</p>

<p>Most sales to Argentine importers currently take place on open accounts. Small- and medium-sized Argentine companies in key sectors with appropriate liquidity invest in technological upgrades in production lines. As a result, open account sales generally take place between small- and medium-sized firms. U.S. exporters should consider open account payment terms only if they have a great deal of trust in the local importer and feel confident in the clients’ ability and willingness to pay.</p>

<p>However, imports are subject to changes in Argentine Government policy that cannot be foreseen. There have been a small number of cases in which the Argentine importer was unable to move foreign exchange out of the country due to a dispute with Argentine authorities over prior transactions involving foreign exchange. It is therefore advisable that in cases where the U.S. exporter would suffer significant hardship due to a delay in payment by the Argentine importer resulting from unforeseen disputes with Argentine authorities or changes in Government policy, that the export be secured with confirmed L/Cs.</p>

<p>Return to Top</p>

<h3>How Does the Banking System Operate?</h3>

<p>In Argentina, Law No. 21,526 of 1977 governs banking activities. Under this law, Argentina’s Central Bank (BCRA) is the implementing authority and the regulatory body, which issues standards and controls activities of financial institutions included in the law (authorization and operating conditions within the banking industry; definition of permitted, prohibited and limited transactions; monetary controls; meeting certain operating ratios; information; accounting and control systems; dissolution and liquidation; etc.). In order to operate in Argentina, foreign banks must register with the BCRA and obtain appropriate authorization prior to engaging in banking activities in Argentina. In addition, there are minimum capital requirements for these entities to be allowed to do business.</p>

<h4>Features of the Argentine Financial System</h4>

<p>Classification</p>

<p>• Commercial banks</p>

<p>o  Government-owned: federal, provincial and municipal</p>

<p>o   Private local banks with Argentine capital: cooperative banks and non-cooperative banks</p>

<p>o   Foreign banks: private local and local branches of foreign banks</p>

<p>• Investment banks</p>

<p>o   Government-owned provincial banks</p>

<p>o   Local banks with foreign capital</p>

<p>• Mortgage banks</p>

<p>• Development banks</p>

<p>• Savings banks</p>

<p>• Finance companies</p>

<p>• Savings and loan associations for building homes or other real estate property</p>

<p>• Credit associations</p>

<p>• Representative offices</p>

<h4>Funding System: Main Transactions</h4>

<p>Financial transactions are generally made in pesos (legal tender), U.S. dollars, and Government securities. The three segments that make up Argentina's financial system are: peso, foreign currency, and the liquid assets under management of all banks in the financial system.</p>

<p>The main transactions are:</p>

<p>• Overdraft</p>

<p>• Promissory notes</p>

<p>• Discount of bills</p>

<p>• Mortgage loans</p>

<p>• Collateral loans</p>

<p>• Consumer loans</p>

<p>• Credit cards</p>

<p>• Demand deposits</p>

<p>• Certificates of deposit</p>

<p>• Common savings deposits</p>

<p>• Deposits in Argentine-government securities</p>

<p>• Interbank transactions</p>

<p>• Swaps</p>

<p>• Bankers acceptances</p>

<p>• Spot exchange transactions</p>

<p>• Forward exchange transactions</p>

<p>In the late nineties, 120 banks operated in Argentina, but after the shake out from the 2002-2003 peso devaluation crisis there are approximately 65 today. However, the financial system is perceived to be healthier than it was during the 90s. Some public banks have improved management quality and, as a result, benefited from a significant increase in deposits over the last few years. Most financial institutions in Argentina continue to expand operations in key niches favoring greater financial margins. Banks currently enjoy higher-quality client-portfolios than in the pre-crisis scenario.</p>

<h3>Foreign-Exchange Controls</h3>

<p>The Argentine government restricts the purchase of foreign currency. For additional information, please visit the Department of State’s investment climate report under conversion and transfer policies. <a href="http://www.state.gov/e/eb/rls/othr/ics/2013/204592.htm">http://www.state.gov/e/eb/rls/othr/ics/2013/204592.htm</a>.</p>

<p>Return to Top</p>

<h3>U.S. Banks and Local Correspondent Banks</h3>

<p>Citibank is the only U.S.-controlled bank operating in Argentina within the retail segment. American Express Bank, Bank of America, Wachovia Bank, J.P. Morgan Chase, The Bank of New York, and First International Bank are other U.S. banks with subsidiaries or representatives in Buenos Aires.</p>

<p>Most Argentine banks maintain correspondent arrangements with U.S. banks. To obtain a list of Argentine Commercial Banks with Offices in the U.S. or banks operating in Argentina, please review the Central Bank of the Argentine Republic web site: <a href="http://www.bcra.gov.ar/sisfin/sf010100_i.asp">http://www.bcra.gov.ar/sisfin/sf010100_i.asp</a> or contact <a href="Marcelo.Amden@trade.gov">Marcelo.Amden@trade.gov</a>.</p>

<h3>Project Financing</h3>

<p>Argentina is currently unable to access international capital markets due to the legal challenges from holders of untendered defaulted debt (the so-called "holdout" bondholders who did not participate in the government's 2005 debt exchange), a situation that has been further compounded by the negative impact of the international economic crisis. As a result, financing options ― both domestic and international ― are scarce and costly in Argentina.</p>

<p>External lines of credit continue to be cut off, and new money entering the local market is primarily used to finance Argentine export transactions. Local banks have stressed that the supplier-importer relationship is key, and that the vast majority of financing options have been reduced to financing offered by the foreign supplier. Nevertheless, there may be some options available to support trade finance for U.S. exports to Argentina, as detailed below.</p>

<h4>The U.S. Export-Import Bank</h4>

<p>The Export-Import (Ex-Im) Bank is open for short and medium-term financing for U.S. exports only to private sector clients in Argentina. Long-term (15 years) financing is available for environmental projects on a case-by-case basis. Bank officials express optimism about Argentina and will continue to monitor the marketplace in order to consider future provisions of export financing for U.S. goods and services.</p>

<p>Ex-Im Bank will consider structured financing arrangements such as some project finance, asset-based aircraft leases, and other financing arrangements in key industries, such as mining, that offer a reasonable assurance of repayment, including reliable access to adequate foreign exchange. In addition, coverage under the Working Capital Guarantee Program may be available for a transaction that is supported by an irrevocable Letter of Credit issued by a bank and/or due from a buyer located in a country where Ex-Im Bank is open without restrictions for short-term transactions.</p>

<p>Visit the Ex-Im Internet site at <a href="http://www.exim.gov/">http://www.exim.gov/</a> for 24-hour access to Ex-Im and its programs, or call their toll free telephone number (800) 565-EXIM.</p>

<h4>Small Business Administration</h4>

<p>The Small Business Administration (SBA) has an Export Working Capital Program to support small and medium-sized exporters. For information about this program and to find your local SBA district office, call 1-800-U-ASK-SBA or search the SBA web site at <a href="http://www.sba.gov/">http://www.sba.gov/</a>. The U.S. Export Assistance Centers (USEAC) of the U.S. Department of Commerce can also provide information on this program. For a list of USEACs call 1-800-USA-TRADE or go to <a href="http://export.gov/usoffices/index.asp">http://export.gov/usoffices/index.asp</a>.</p>

<h4>Multilateral Development Bank Operations</h4>

<p>The <a href="http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTABOUTUS/EXTIBRD/0,,menuPK:3046081~pagePK:64168427~piPK:64168435~theSitePK:3046012,00.html">International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)</a> provides funding for projects in Argentina. It also provides technical assistance and policy advice. IBRD raises money through the sale of AAA-rated bonds in international capital markets. Loans are made only to governments or to agencies that can obtain a government guarantee. The IBRD also provides partial risk or partial credit guarantees (with a counter-guarantee from their government) to private lenders on development projects. The interest rates are variable, set at half a percentage point above the Bank's average cost of borrowing or LIBOR. Repayment is usually 12-15 years, including a grace period of three to five years. Opportunities exist for U.S. companies to supply goods and services financed by these loans.</p>

<p>For contact information on World Bank projects in Argentina visit : <a href="http://web.worldbank.org/external/projects/main?pagePK=217672&amp;piPK=95916&amp;theSitePK=40941&amp;menuPK=223661&amp;category=regcountries&amp;regioncode=7&amp;countrycode=AR">http://web.worldbank.org/external/projects/main?pagePK=217672&amp;piPK=95916&amp;theSitePK=4 0941&amp;menuPK=223661&amp;category=regcountries&amp;regioncode=7&amp;countrycode=AR</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/corp_ext_content/ifc_external_corporate_site/home">International Finance Corporation (IFC)</a>, an affiliate of the World Bank, also provides project financing for private investment in Argentina. IFC offers long-term loans, equity investments, and other financing services. IFC will generally invest up to 25 percent of the total project cost. Besides project finance, IFC also provides legal and technical assistance to private enterprises. Unlike the IBRD, the IFC does not require government guarantees. U.S. companies seeking direct investment funds should <a href="http://www1.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/region__ext_content/regions/latin+america+and+the+caribbean/contacts/lac+contacts+default+landing+page">contact the IFC</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.miga.org/">Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)</a> was established in April 1988 to help investors address problems of political risk. Investors' concerns about political risk slowed the flow of foreign direct investment, which in turn slowed the creation of jobs and the transfer of modern technology. MIGA's purpose is to promote the flow of foreign direct investment among member countries by insuring investments against non-commercial (political) risk and by providing promotional and advisory services to help member countries create an attractive investment climate. U.S. companies seeking investment guarantees should <a href="http://www.miga.org/contact/index.cfm">contact MIGA</a>. NOTE: The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) also provides investment guarantees - more information below.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.iadb.org/">Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)</a> also provides financial support to projects in Argentina at similar interest rates and with similar repayment terms. The relationship between the <a href="http://www.iic.int/home.asp">Inter-American Investment Corporation (IIC)</a> and the IDB is similar to that of the IFC and the World Bank.</p>

<h4>U.S. Department of Commerce Liaison Officers</h4>

<p>At each of the multilateral development banks, the U.S. Department of Commerce has a liaison officer who advocates for U.S. firms and counsels them on multilateral bank opportunities. They are a valuable source of information on Multilateral Development Bank funded projects in Argentina.</p>

<h4>Overseas Private Investment Corporation</h4>

<p>The <a href="http://www.opic.gov/">Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC)</a> offers assistance to U.S. private investors in the form of political risk insurance, as well as loans and loan guarantees for their direct investment in Argentina. OPIC's main programs are:</p>

<p><em>Investment Insurance</em>: Provides insurance against the risks of currency inconvertibility, expropriation, and the loss of assets or income caused by political violence. Coverage is available for new investments and for investments to expand or modernize existing operations.</p>

<p><em>Investment Programs</em>: Medium- to long-term financing for sound overseas investment projects is made available through loan guarantees and direct loans. Loan guarantees generally range from $10 million to $75 million, and direct loans generally range from $2 million to $10 million. Direct loans are reserved for projects involving small businesses or cooperatives. OPIC's financing commitment may range from 50 percent of total project costs for new ventures to up to 75 percent for expansions of existing operations with maturities of five to twelve years (and in some cases longer). Contact: <a href="http://www.opic.gov/">http://www.opic.gov</a>. Information officer: (202) 336-8799, Fax: (202) 408-5155. There is an automated information service via a fax retrieval line: (202) 336-8700.</p>

<h4>Leasing</h4>

<p>The passage of Leasing Law No. 25.248 in 2000 raised the stature of leasing as a financing option. Currently, leasing operations are mostly of equipment. Leasing activities increased approximately 30 percent year-on-year from 2011 to 2012, and industry experts expect this trend to continue evolving. Furthermore, leasing operations account for less than five percent of investment in Argentina, which represents a significant opportunity for growth. During 2012, there were approximately 20,000 leasing operations, amounting to roughly $1 billion. Some of the perceived advantages of leasing entail: installments that are fully deductible from capital gains taxes, no property taxes or taxes on interest, VAT applied proportionately on installments rather than up front, and accelerated depreciation. However, foreign firms that wish to lease equipment to Argentine customers must do so via an Argentine registered subsidiary. Some foreign firms that engage in leasing via their Argentine subsidiaries have reported difficulties in repatriating lease payments to their foreign parent firm.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Latin America and the Caribbean is a large and natural market for US exporters due to the region’s geographic proximity. The region has a total population of 546 million people and a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of nearly $2.5 trillion. The region is also home to two of the world’s largest economies, Brazil and Mexico, whose combined GDP is over $1.5 trillion.</p>

<p>Despite the sheer size of this market, many US exporters are unsuccessful in selling to Latin America or increasing their exports to Latin American buyers. Frequently, US exporters lose sales due to the payment terms they demand of their Latin American buyers.</p>

<p>US exporters should be aware of the fact that Latin American lending rates are far higher than those faced by companies in the US. For example, <strong>Brazilian lending rates range from 20% to 30% per year and Mexican lending rates range from 9% to 14% per year</strong> (as of January 2007). US exporters are losing sales to Latin American buyers because they are frequently demanding payment either by Confirmed Letter of Credit or Cash In Advance. This can result in the following situations:</p>

<li>US exporter <em><strong>fails to win</strong></em> new sales contracts or loses existing Latin American clients because other foreign competitors are willing to provide the Latin American buyer with open account terms. Some Latin American companies pay more just to get 30 or 60-day open account terms.</li>
<li>US exporter <em><strong>sells less</strong></em> to a Latin American client. One Latin American company interviewed stated that it would purchase 4 times as much from its US supplier if it was given 90-day terms rather than having to pay cash in advance.</li>
<li>US exporter <em><strong>loses</strong></em> medium term sales contract, because a foreign competitor assists the Latin American buyer in achieving better financing terms.</li>
</ol>


<p>While it is prudent for US exporters to insist on secure payment terms, it pays for them to consider the broad variety of payment terms available to them in order to become as competitive as possible.</p>

<p>The purpose of this guide is to identify the main financing and payment mechanisms available to support US exporters selling to Latin America in general and to understand the costs, advantages, and disadvantages of each mechanism. This guide is an introduction and the reader is encouraged to use it as a starting point in order to become more familiar with the subject. In many instances, the use of expert help is recommended. To that end, the following mechanisms will be examined in this report:</p>

<ol>
<li>Cash In Advance;</li>
<li>Confirmed Letter of Credit;</li>
<li>Open Account Terms;</li>
<li>Open Account Terms with Export Credit Insurance;</li>
<li>Documents Against Payment (D/P) &amp; Documents Against Acceptance (D/A);</li>
<li>Export Finance by a US Commercial Bank (US$ denominated);</li>
<li>Import Finance by a Latin American Bank (Foreign Currency denominated);</li>
<li>Lines of Credit Available from Latin American-based Development Banks;</li>
<li>Sales to foreign public sector buyers with foreign Central Bank Guarantees are also addressed.</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Overview of Main Payment Terms and Associated Costs for Exports to Latin America</strong></p>

<p><img src="../images/main-payment-terms.png" alt="Argentina" /></p>

<h3>What Do All These Financing Options Mean?</h3>

<p>Each of these options will be covered in some detail in separate sections. We show you a short table that gives you an idea of whether the financing mechanism is appropriate for the sale you want to make. We point out the advantages and disadvantages of each, both for you as a US exporter and for your Latin American buyer. There’s a diagram that shows you how the financing is structured. And, where appropriate, we add comments and examples to make each option even clearer.</p>

<p><strong>This guide is just the first step</strong></p>

<p>However, please note that this guide is meant to give you, the US exporter, a preliminary overview. A variety of issues are not considered. Once you’re ready to take the next step, we encourage you to contact us through our website at <a href="www.buyusa.gov/tradeamericas/">www.buyusa.gov/tradeamericas/</a>. Our sector-specific contacts are listed there and are ready to assist you.</p>

<h3>How do High Interest Rates Affect My Export Sales?</h3>

<p><strong>If you sell to a country that has high interest rates and you demand cash in advance or a letter of credit from your buyer, you will likely sell less and may even lose the sale to a competitor who is willing to provide better payment terms.</strong></p>

<p>Why? Simply put, when a company, any company, is faced with high interest rates, they will do everything they can to avoid borrowing money. This includes:</p>

<ol>
<li>Buying less.</li>
<li>Not buying at all.</li>
<li>Paying more to buy on open account terms.</li>
<li>Buying inferior product if it is being sold on open account terms.</li>
</ol>


<p>The following example highlights what many Latin American Companies face when trying to decide what and how much to import:</p>

<p><em>Imagine that you are a buyer in Latin America and you want to purchase $100,000 worth of widgets from a US exporter to stock your warehouse. It will take approximately 30 days for the widgets to arrive and then it will take another 90 days to sell the widgets. In addition, your local client will demand 90 days to pay you. In total, then, you will only be paid for the product you purchased from your US supplier 7 months (210 days) after you purchased it.</em></p>

<p>• <em>In Brazil, if you took a line of credit where interest rates are approximately 2.2% per month, you will pay your bank $16,454 in interest (compounded monthly).</em></p>

<p>• <em>In Mexico, if you took a line of credit where interest rates are approximately 1.1% per month, you will pay your bank $6,784 in interest (compounded monthly).</em></p>

<h3>Getting Paid</h3>

<ul>
<li>Option 1: Cash in Advance or Prepayment</li>
<li>Option 2: Confirmed Letter of Credit (LC)</li>
<li>Option 3: Unsecured Open Account Terms</li>
<li>Option 4: Open Account Terms with Export Credit Insurance</li>

</ul>


<h4>Option 1: Cash in Advance or Prepayment</h4>

<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>

<p><img src="../images/option-1-overview.png" alt="Argentina" /></p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>Latin American buyer transfers payment to US exporter’s account prior to the US exporter shipping goods.</p>

<p><img src="../images/option-1-description.png" alt="Argentina" /></p>

<p><strong>Comments:</strong></p>

<p>If Export Credit Insurance or alternative sources of financing are not options, cash in advance is likely the most prudent payment mechanism for a US exporter selling to a Latin American buyer:</p>

<ol>
<li>Who is a first time client;</li>
<li>Who isn’t well known to the US Company;</li>
<li>Who is financially weak;</li>
<li>Who has a history of payment default;</li>
<li>Who is operating under the foreign equivalent of Chapter 11 bankruptcy.</li>
</ol>


<p><img src="../images/option-1-diagram.png" alt="Argentina" /></p>

<h4>Option 2: Confirmed Letter of Credit (LC)</h4>

<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>

<p><img src="../images/option-2-overview.png" alt="Argentina" /></p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>A Letter of Credit is a legal document issued by a bank (domestic or foreign) that assures payment based upon the performance of certain documentary conditions and requirements by the US exporter as stipulated within the terms of the buyer’s credit. The added confirmation by a US bank means that a US bank will pay the US exporter when the Letter of Credit is presented to them in the US. The US bank will then demand the funds from the Latin American bank because the US bank has confirmed the US exporter has performed according to the terms of the Letter of Credit. It is important to note that the actual wording of the Letter of Credit document is subject to negotiation between the buyer, exporter and their banks.</p>

<p><img src="../images/option-2-description.png" alt="Argentina" /></p>

<p><strong>Comments:</strong></p>

<p>Although Confirmed LCs are a very secure form of payment, many US exporters lose sales and / or sell less to Latin America due to their insistence on either Confirmed LCs or Cash in Advance. While great care must be taken when selling to any foreign buyer, other less secure forms of payment should be considered by US exporters if a given buyer is particularly creditworthy or other forms of security, such as export credit insurance, are available.</p>

<p>The cost of a Confirmed LC of less than one year does not generally drop in Latin America. Accordingly, for short-term transactions, the cost is particularly expensive relative to the term. For example, a Latin American company purchasing $100,000 in goods from a US exporter will pay between $3,000 and $4,000 for a confirmed LC regardless of whether it is for 90 days or 1 year.</p>

<p><img src="../images/option-2-diagram.png" alt="Argentina" /></p>

<h4>Option 3: Unsecured Open Account Terms</h4>

<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>

<p><img src="../images/option-3-overview.png" alt="Argentina" /></p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>A US exporter agrees to ship goods to the Latin American buyer prior to receiving payment. The purchase order or sales contract indicates at what point in the future the Latin American buyer is obliged to pay the US exporter. Normally the Latin American buyer will transfer the funds to the US exporter at a certain point in the future. Generally open account terms are short-term and rarely exceed 120 days. It should be noted that 30, 60 and 90 days are most common in Latin America.</p>

<p><img src="../images/option-3-description.png" alt="Argentina" /></p>

<p><strong>Comments:</strong></p>

<p>Selling on Unsecured Open Account terms is highly risky for US exporters and is generally not recommended without the added security of Export Credit Insurance. US exporters should only consider providing Unsecured Open Account terms to Latin American buyers for:</p>

<p>• Firms that are very creditworthy;</p>

<p>• Firms that US exporters have had a great deal of favorable experience with.</p>

<p><img src="../images/option-3-diagram.png" alt="Argentina" /></p>

<h4>Option 4: Open Account Terms with Export Credit Insurance</h4>

<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>

<p><img src="../images/option-4-overview.png" alt="Argentina" /></p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>The transaction is exactly the same as that of Open Account except that the US exporter purchases Export Credit Insurance and the Credit Insurer agrees to reimburse the US exporter up to 90% of the value of the receivable in the event that the Latin American buyer declares bankruptcy, defaults on payment or cannot pay due to one of a variety of political risks.</p>

<p>It is important to recognize that some Credit Insurance policies provide broader coverage than others. Use of a specialist Credit Insurance broker is highly recommended.</p>

<p><img src="../images/option-4-description.png" alt="Argentina" /></p>

<p><strong>Comments:</strong></p>

<p>Open account sales covered by Export Credit Insurance are considered by many to strike an excellent balance between prudence and the desire to provide competitive payment terms that won’t undermine sales. The costs associated with Export Credit Insurance are minimal when compared to the costs of Confirmed Letters of Credit. Generally an exporter can charge back the minimal insurance costs to their buyers by increasing their prices from between the 0.08% to 1.5% in accordance with the cost of their insurance program.</p>

<p>Open account terms with Credit Insurance are more secure than simple unsecured open account terms. However, they are not considered as secure as Cash In Advance or Confirmed LC, as Export Credit Insurance is a conditional guarantee that includes certain conditions and exclusions. For example, a typical Export Credit Insurance policy excludes payment in the event of a dispute between the buyer and seller until the dispute is resolved. Due to the complexity of Export Credit Insurance and the fact that policy terms and conditions vary dramatically among insurers, the use of an insurance broker with specialized experience with Credit Insurance is highly recommended.</p>

<p>The US Export Credit Insurance market is competitive. There are currently eight principal Credit Insurers available to US Exporters:</p>

<ol>
<li>AIG;</li>
<li>Atradius (NCM);</li>
<li>Chubb;</li>
<li>Coface;</li>
<li>Euler Hermes;</li>
<li>Export  –  Import  Bank  of  the  United States (Ex-Im Bank);</li>
<li>FCIA;</li>
<li>Zurich.</li>
</ol>


<p>In the past many US exporters found that Export Credit Insurers were reluctant to approve key buyers in Latin America. While this was indeed the case, Export Credit Insurers are increasingly willing to assume risk in the region.</p>

<p>For many Small and Medium Sized US Exporters who export to Latin America, Export Credit Insurance is a valuable tool. If an insurer is unwilling to provide coverage for a particular buyer, that buyer is most likely considered to be high risk. In this case, the US exporter should probably insist on receiving a Confirmed LC or Cash In Advance.</p>

<p><img src="../images/option-4-diagram.png" alt="Argentina" /></p>

<p><strong>Looking at some examples.</strong></p>

<p>On the next page we show examples of how both the Catastrophic and No or Low Deductible Programs might actually work. It bears repeating that we advise US Exporters to consult a specialist Credit Insurance broker before proceeding further.</p>

<p><strong>Types of Export Credit Insurance Programs</strong></p>

<p>The following two diagrams highlight the two main types of programs available to US exporters, a <strong>No or Low Deductible Program</strong> and a <strong>High or Catastrophic Deductible Program</strong>. The No Deductible Program is more expensive as it pays claims regardless of loss size. Two payment default scenarios are listed after each program type and show how much indemnity the insured US exporter would receive in the event of a $600,000 default and a $100,000 default. These programs are representative only and actual premium and deductible levels will depend on the US exporter and their insured buyers.</p>

<p><img src="../images/option-4-types.png" alt="Argentina" /></p>

<h4>Option 5: Documentary Collections: Documents Against Payment (D/P) &amp; Documents Against Acceptance (D/A)</h4>

<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>

<p><img src="../images/option-5-overview.png" alt="Argentina" /></p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>US exporter delivers shipping documents and a trade draft to a bank in the US. This bank is known as the <strong>remitting bank</strong> and issues the collection order normally according to the ICC Uniform Rules for Collections. As a matter of additional risk protection, the US exporter will normally make any title documents consigned to the order of the Buyer’s bank.</li>
<li>The bank in the US then forwards the shipping documents and the trade draft to its correspondent bank in Latin America. This bank is known as the <strong>collecting bank</strong>.</li>
<li>The correspondent (collecting) bank then notifies the Latin American buyer that the collection order has arrived with the terms and documents are available upon their acceptance of the terms.</li>
<li>Normally, foreign buyers will wait for confirmation that the goods have arrived at customs in their country.</li>
<li><p>Then one of two things happens, depending on the trade draft payment mechanism selected by the US exporter
– either</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>  <em>For Documents Against Payment (D/P)</em>, also referred to as <em>Cash Against Documents</em> or <em>Sight Collection</em>, buyers will then pay the collecting bank against presentation of the seller’s “Sight” trade draft in order to receive the shipping documents so that they may then present the documents to their country’s customs agency for clearance of the goods.</li>
</ol>


<p>  <strong>or</strong></p>

<ol type="a">
<li>  <em>For Documents Against Acceptance (D/A)</em>, also referred to as <em>Term or Time Collections</em>, buyers will then accept, by signature, the Seller’s “Time trade draft in order to receive the shipping documents so that they may then obtain and subsequently present the documents to their country’s customs agency for clearance of the goods. After the term, normally 30, 60 or 90 days, buyers are obligated to pay the collecting bank that will in turn remit the funds to US exporters via their US remitting bank. Under this mechanism, the US exporter has extended payment terms to the buyer who must accept the terms of their trade draft which upon acceptance by the buyer becomes a legal and binding obligation between the parties and upon which the collecting bank can release the documents.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>


<p><img src="../images/option-5-description.png" alt="Argentina" /></p>

<p><strong>Comments:</strong></p>

<p>• Documents Against Payment (D/P) is considered to be a very secure payment mechanism for US exporters although they do face the risk that the foreign buyer will refuse to accept the goods. It is always wise for the US exporter to consult with their bank on how best to protect themselves, their collection order and their rights to, and transfer of, the title documents.</p>

<p>• Documents Against Acceptance (D/A) is considered to be a risky payment mechanism and is not recommended for US exporters <strong>unless</strong> they have a great deal of experience with a foreign buyer or if the foreign buyer is large and considered extremely creditworthy. It is considered only slightly less risky than unsecured open account terms in that the buyer has signed a legally binding document pledging to pay.</p>

<p>Shipping documents forwarded to the correspondent bank normally include:</p>

<p>• Bill of Lading OR Airway Bill.</p>

<p>• Invoice.</p>

<p>• Certificate of Origin (Sometimes).</p>

<p>• Proof of Insurance (Sometimes).</p>

<p><img src="../images/option-5-diagram.png" alt="Argentina" /></p>

<h4>Option 6: Export Finance by US Commercial Bank (in US$)</h4>

<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>

<p><img src="../images/option-6-overview.png" alt="Argentina" /></p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>The basics of Export Finance are very simple. In essence, a bank pays a US exporter in advance for goods to be shipped to a Latin American buyer. Beyond the basics however, there are two main variations of Export Finance.</p>

<p><strong>Variation 1: Supplier vs. Buyer Credit: Who is responsible for repaying the loan?</strong></p>

<p><strong>The first variation depends on who, contractually, is assuming the responsibility for repaying the loan.</strong> Is it the US Exporter or is it the Foreign Buyer? If the Exporter is responsible for repaying the loan it is called <strong>Supplier Credit</strong>. If the Buyer is responsible for repaying the loan, it is called <strong>Buyer Credit</strong>.</p>

<p>Accordingly, Supplier Credit is far riskier for the US Exporter than Buyer Credit due to the fact that under the terms of Supplier Credit, even if the foreign buyer fails to pay the US Exporter the US Exporter is still contractually obliged to repay the lending bank the full loan amount.</p>

<p>It is important to recognize that when US exporters sell to foreign buyers, including Latin America, it is rare that banks will approve Credit (either Supplier or Buyer) without a guarantee from either Ex-Im Bank Guarantee (or another Export Credit Insurer). Accordingly, the following two types of Export Finance are uncommon but do exist in cases in which the US Exporter is well known and extremely strong financially (in the case of Supplier Credit) or in which the Foreign Buyer is well known and extremely strong financially (in the case of Buyer Credit).</p>

<p>The general process of arranging Supplier Credit is as follows:</p>

<p>1.)  Bank in US works with the US exporter and buyer to arrange financing.</p>

<p>2.)  Loan documentation is arranged and signed between the US bank and the US exporter.</p>

<p>3.) The US bank discounts the promissory note issued by the foreign buyer which is made payable to the US exporter.</p>

<p>The general process of arranging Buyer Credit is as follows:</p>

<p>1.)  Bank located in US works with the buyer and exporter to arrange financing.</p>

<p>2.) Loan documentation is arranged and signed between the US bank and the foreign buyer. Financing terms and conditions are based on the buyer’s credit worthiness.</p>

<p>3.)  The US bank pays the US exporter on behalf of the foreign buyer.</p>

<p><strong>Variation 2: With or Without Credit Guarantee - Is a credit guarantee used by the lending institution?</strong></p>

<p><strong>The second main variation of Export Finance is whether or not a credit guarantee is used by the lending bank to provide it with security against the risk of non-payment</strong> by either the US Exporter (in the case of Supplier Credit) or the Foreign Buyer (in the case of Buyer Credit). Credit Guarantees are frequently provided to US Banks by U.S. Ex-Im Bank or other credit insurers, as outlined in the section on Export Credit Insurance.</p>

<p>The following four diagrams highlight both simple Supplier Credit and Buyer Credit without an Ex-Im Bank Guarantee and Supplier Credit and Buyer Credit with an Ex-Im Bank Guarantee. Due to the fact that loan costs increase when the lending bank uses a Guarantee the total loan cost increases accordingly.</p>

<h5>Variation 1: Buyer and Supplier Credit Without Ex-Im Bank Guarantee – Typical Costs</h5>

<p><img src="../images/variation-1-cost.png" alt="Argentina" /></p>

<p><img src="../images/variation-1-diagram.png" alt="Argentina" /></p>

<h5>Variation 2: Buyer and Supplier Credit With Ex-Im Bank Guarantee – Typical Costs</h5>

<p><img src="../images/variation-2-cost.png" alt="Argentina" /></p>

<p><img src="../images/variation-1-diagram.png" alt="Argentina" /></p>

<p><strong>Advantages and Disadvantages of Supplier Credit:</strong></p>

<p><img src="../images/supplier-credit.png" alt="Argentina" /></p>

<p><strong>Advantages and Disadvantages of Buyer Credit:</strong></p>

<p><img src="../images/buyer-credit.png" alt="Argentina" /></p>

<p><strong>Comments / Additional Information:</strong></p>

<p>In general export financings of sales to buyers in most Latin American countries contain a 6-month grace period after which the buyer/supplier must begin repaying the bank.</p>

<p>The costs (premium) associated with a US Ex-Im Bank Guarantee (or that of another credit insurer) range from approximately 1.5% and 2% per year in addition to the cost of funding from the commercial bank. Premium can fluctuate dramatically based on the perceived risk of a given buyer. In other words, the weaker the borrower, the more expensive the premium.</p>

<p>Due to the added complexity and additional work required to arrange the transaction, the finance cost generally increases more than the simple cost of the Ex-Im Bank Guarantee. Banks interviewed indicated that Export Finance for US exports to Latin America with an Ex-Im Bank Guarantee generally cost as follows and depends on the amount financed:</p>

<p>Ex-Im Bank Credit Benchmarks:</p>

<p>Foreign buyers must meet a number of minimum credit benchmarks in order to be approved for an Ex-Im Bank loan guarantee (please see <a href="http://www.exim.gov/">www.exim.gov</a>). The following are among the key credit standards that generally must be met:</p>

<p>• Positive Operating Profit over last 2 years.</p>

<p>• Positive Net Income over last 2 years.</p>

<p>• Positive Cash Flow From Operations (latest year).</p>

<p>• EBITDA / Debt Service greater than 150%.</p>

<p>• Total Liabilities/Total Net Worth less than 175%.</p>

<p>• Ex-Im Bank Exposure/Total Net Worth less than 40%.</p>

<h4>Option 7: Import Finance by a Latin American Bank (in Foreign Currency)</h4>

<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>

<p><img src="../images/option-7-overview.png" alt="Argentina" /></p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>A Latin American bank pays a US exporter in advance for goods to be shipped to a Latin American buyer. The Latin American bank is essentially providing the Latin American buyer a loan and the Latin American buyer will have to repay the bank as contractually agreed in the financing agreement between the bank and the buyer. In Latin America, these financings generally have a 6-month grace period after which the buyer must begin repaying the Bank.</p>

<p><img src="../images/option-7-description.png" alt="Argentina" /></p>

<p><strong>Comments:</strong></p>

<p>• Although this option is extremely expensive for Latin American buyers it is frequently the only alternative available to them, particularly when they are purchasing larger ticket capital equipment items.</p>

<p><img src="../images/option-7-diagram.png" alt="Argentina" /></p>

<h4>Option 8: Direct Loan by Local Development Bank to Buyer (in foreign currency)</h4>

<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>

<p><img src="../images/option-8-overview.png" alt="Argentina" /></p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>Latin American companies can arrange at-market or even below-market direct loans with certain Development Banks. In many cases, the funds can be used to purchase goods from US Exporters.</p>

<p><img src="../images/option-8-description.png" alt="Argentina" /></p>

<p><strong>Comments:</strong></p>

<p>There are a number of development banks in Latin America. Many countries have both federally supported and state-level supported development banks. The attractiveness of these loans varies from country to country, so we recommend contacting us at <a href="www.buyusa.gov/tradeamericas/">www.buyusa.gov/tradeamericas/</a> for more information on a particular development bank.</p>

<p><img src="../images/option-8-diagram.png" alt="Argentina" /></p>

<h4>Option 9: Sales to Public Sector with Foreign Central Bank Guarantee</h4>

<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>

<p><img src="../images/option-9-overview.png" alt="Argentina" /></p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>When federal, state and municipal entities in Latin American purchase goods abroad, Central Banks of the purchasing country will frequently issue a guarantee to the foreign exporter. Many US firms currently accept Central Bank guarantees and sell on what can essentially be considered to be open account terms secured by the Central Bank guarantee.</p>

<p>For larger ticket items, many US exporters seek a bank to prepay all or part of the purchase price. As a result a financial institution, either US or Latin American-based, may finance the transaction.</p>

<p>Some US Banks may seek sovereign guarantee insurance from a US insurer in order to gain additional transaction security, particularly for extremely large transactions.</p>

<p><img src="../images/option-9-description.png" alt="Argentina" /></p>

<p><strong>Comments:</strong></p>

<p>Central Bank guarantees are excellent tools that enable foreign public sector buyers to obtain credit and/or lower cost financing.</p>

<p>There are 3 basic variations of the simple Central Bank Guarantee, shown in increasing complexity:</p>

<p><img src="../images/simple-guarantee.png" alt="Argentina" /></p>

<h3>Business Customs</h3>

<p>U.S. businesspeople should take the time to develop a close personal relationship with their agent, representative, distributor, or other business partner. Argentine business customs are generally more formal than those in the United States. Business dress, appearance, and general demeanor are more conservative.</p>

<p>Courtesy is very important, and efforts to rush a business deal are likely to be unsuccessful. No encounter starts with a business discussion. To develop a solid business relationship and establish trust it is important to devote some time to discussing family members, sports, and social activities. At meetings it is important to shake hands with everyone in the room upon arrival and departure. Among Argentines it is customary for men to kiss women they meet for the first time on the right cheek. However, Americans should shake hands with Argentine women until a friendly relationship has been established.</p>

<p>Contacts and introductions are important and therefore, it is advisable to use the services of the U.S. Commercial Service at the U.S. Embassy in Buenos Aires, or other organizations such as the American Chamber of Commerce, industry associations, and other intermediaries, rather than rely on a direct "cold call" approach. The U.S. Commercial Service in Argentina offers a complete package for the businessperson to meet with potential business partners.</p>

<p>It is important that you arrive promptly to business meetings, though your Argentine contact may be slightly late, and to always have a pre-arranged appointment. Be sure to have an ample supply of business cards. Although not essential, it is beneficial to have cards printed in Spanish as well as English.</p>

<p>One cultural note is that it is not good form to say you are from "America." In Latin America, the term "America" denotes both North and South America, not just the United States. Therefore, it is better to call yourself a “North American” (<em>norteamericano</em>).</p>

<h3>Currency</h3>

<p>The Argentine currency is the peso and is signified by the same symbol ($) as the U.S. dollar. ATM machines are widely available in Buenos Aires, allowing travelers with a variety of credit or debit cards to withdraw funds automatically in local currency. Although usually accepted at most hotels, traveler’s checks are often refused by business establishments and can be difficult or expensive to change at banks. Note that you will be able to obtain pesos only at ATMs, due to currency controls.</p>

<p>Visitors should be cautious of strangers offering to exchange currency. This black market (often referred to as the “blue” or “azul” market) is illegal and participants could be subject to arrest and prosecution. Participants may also open themselves to attack by criminal elements.</p>

<h3>Visa Requirements</h3>

<p>Visas are not required for U.S. citizens traveling to Argentina for up to 90 days of tourism or business, except holders of U.S. Diplomatic and Official passports. However, the Argentine Government implemented a reciprocal Visa Fee on all foreign nationals whose governments require visas of Argentines. This fee must be paid online at the Provincia Pagos website, before you board a flight for Argentina. Once paid, you must print out the receipt and present it to the Argentine immigration officer at the time of entry. Airlines will not allow you to board unless you present the receipt as proof of payment. The link to the site is: <a href="http://www.migraciones.gov.ar/accesible/templates/reciprocidad/reciprocidad.htm">http://www.migraciones.gov.ar/accesible/templates/reciprocidad/reciprocidad.htm</a>.</p>

<p>For American citizens, the fee is currently $160.00 and is valid for ten years and multiple entries into Argentina. Visitors may request an extension of stay up to 90 additional days from the Argentine Immigration Service at:</p>

<h4>Work and other Extended Visas</h4>

<p>Although it is theoretically possible to arrange a work permit following arrival in Argentina, the process is much more complicated and time-consuming than applying for the work visa abroad, and one may not legally begin remunerated employment until permission has been granted. Therefore, it is important to begin the work visa process as early as possible by applying at an Argentine consular office in the United States or abroad. This process can still be quite lengthy and require many civil documents (e.g., birth and marriage certificates) and police certificates. U.S. civil documents submitted to Argentine consular offices do not require Argentine consular certification. The government of Argentina requires only a Hague Convention apostille certificate from the Secretary of State of the U.S. state where the document was issued or from the U.S. Department of State for U.S. federal government-issued documents.</p>

<p>Argentine immigration law provides for the following temporary and permanent resident categories and conditions:</p>

<p>• <em>Transitory residents, tourists, and students</em> are not allowed to carry on a remunerated or profitable activity unless expressly authorized by the immigration authorities.</p>

<p>• <em>Temporary residents</em> may perform such activities during their authorized stay if they obtain a work permit. The work permit can be obtained from the immigration authorities at the Immigration Office after filing relevant documentation. The permit authorizes a stay from one to three years.</p>

<p>• <em>Permanent residents</em> may perform any type of remunerated or profitable activity, either as employees or self-employed.</p>

<p>There are special immigration provisions for some foreign professional, scientific, or technical research personnel hired abroad to render services in Argentina for a maximum of two years. They must not be residents in Argentina and must be covered for contingencies such as old age, disability, or death by the law of their own country.</p>

<p>U.S. Companies that require travel of foreign businesspersons to the United States should be advised that security evaluations are handled via an interagency process. Visa applicants should go to the following links.</p>

<h3>Telecommunications</h3>

<p>Telephone service, both international and local, is adequate, with several providers such as Telecom, Telefónica, Claro, Nextel, and Movistar, among others, offering service. Cell and smart phones are widely used and available. There is also a wide range of cable television channels available, including CNN International, <em>CNN en Español</em>, FOX, WB, Sony, MTV, and channels from Brazil, Chile, Mexico, France, Germany, Italy, and elsewhere. Cable and satellite TV are very common.</p>

<h4>Electric Current</h4>

<p>Electric current in Argentina is AC 220 volts, 50 cycles in the case of one phase; AC 380 volts, 50 cycles for three phases. Electric plug configurations are usually 2-3 flat pins with the top two slightly angled to form a "Y" shape or two round-tipped straight pins.</p>

<p>Return to Top</p>

<h3>Transportation</h3>

<p>U.S. carriers flying to Argentina include American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines. The primary gateways are Dallas, Houston, Miami, New York, and Atlanta. The Argentine carrier, Aerolineas Argentinas, also flies between the U.S. and Argentina. In-country travel, and travel between Argentina and other South American countries, is widely available from a variety of Argentine and foreign carriers. Two main airports serve Buenos Aires; Aeroparque Jorge Newbery, which is located near downtown serving domestic flights and some regional flights to Uruguay and Paraguay, and Ezeiza International Airport, which is a 45-minute drive from Buenos Aires, serving all other international flights, including those from the U.S.</p>

<p>Taxis are plentiful and are generally the most effective way of moving around Buenos Aires. A widely available private car service, called "<em>remise</em>", is also available and is the recommended method of travel from Ezeiza International Airport into Buenos Aires. <em>Remise</em> services have counters at the airport. For security reasons, the U.S. Embassy in Buenos Aires recommends that travelers use either <em>remises</em> or radio taxis, rather than hailing taxis on the street.</p>

<p>Travel in Argentina can be accomplished by train, bus, or car, although air travel is recommended for many trips to key cities in the provinces due to large distances. Automobile rental is available throughout the country, although it is quite expensive compared to U.S. rental costs. Travelers should be aware that Argentina has a high rate of auto accidents, and driving is not recommended for short visits.</p>

<p>Return to Top</p>

<h3>Language</h3>

<p>Spanish is the national language of Argentina, although many businesspeople speak English as well as other European languages. Do not assume, however, that your contacts will speak English. For U.S. businesspeople who already speak Spanish, note that Argentina has distinct differences in pronunciation, cadence, and vocabulary.</p>

<p>Almost all business in Argentina is conducted in Spanish, and all documents and records must be in that language to constitute valid evidence. Business documents in a foreign language should be translated by a certified public translator to be presented for legal purposes to Argentine authorities. A list of certified public translators is available upon request from the U.S. Commercial Service in Argentina (<a href="Office.BuenosAires@trade.gov">Office.BuenosAires@trade.gov</a>).</p>

<h3>Health</h3>

<p>Buenos Aires has no particular health risks and no special precaution needs to be taken. Sanitary conditions are good. Tap water is safe. Many competent doctors, dentists, and specialists are available in Buenos Aires. Outside of Buenos Aires or other major cities, basic precautions, such as drinking bottled water, are recommended. Prior to travelling to Argentina, it is advisable to consult with your medical professional and review the Department of State's Bureau of Consular Affairs web site for general travel information: <a href="http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1130.html#medical">http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1130.html#medical</a>.</p>

<h3>Local Time, Business Hours, and Holidays</h3>

<p>Argentina is three hours behind Greenwich Mean Time (UTC). Argentina is + 1 hour U.S. Eastern Daylight Time (Summer Time) and +2 hours Eastern Standard Time (winter). The 24-hour system is used rather than the 12-hour a.m. / p.m. system. There is only one time zone for all of Argentina. Click here for the current time in Argentina.</p>

<p>Formal business office hours are Monday through Friday from 9.00 a.m. to 6.00 p.m. (two hours earlier for factories) with one-hour lunch break, but many office workers begin and end their days later. Work luncheons are frequent for business people and they generally extend from 1.00 to 3.00 p.m. Business dinners and dinners in general begin at 9.00 p.m. Most retail stores are open from 9.00/10.00 a.m. to between 6.00 and 9.00 p.m., Monday through Saturday; however, many small shops close for the weekend at 1:00 or 2:00 on Saturday. Banks are open to the public from Monday through Friday from 10.00 a.m. to 3.00 p.m.</p>

<p>Since Argentina is in the Southern Hemisphere, its seasons are the reverse of those in the Northern Hemisphere. Summer in the United States is winter in Argentina, and vice versa. School summer vacations take place from approximately Christmas to March, instead of June through August, and there is a two week winter school vacation in July.</p>

<p>It is often difficult to conduct business in Argentina in January and February, since most businesses are either closed or working on a limited schedule. Ask your business contacts when it is best to come, and plan travel times and clothing accordingly. Summer, December through March, is hot and humid in Buenos Aires. The coldest months are July and August (winter), with temperatures between 30°F and 50°F.</p>

<h3>Temporary Entry of Materials and Personal Belongings</h3>

<p>According to Argentine law, personal working elements such as laptop computers, cellular phones, and other tools must be registered at Customs at the time of entry and again upon departure from Argentina. Samples brought into the country by a traveling salesperson are admitted free of duty provided they have no commercial value. Otherwise, the traveler may be required to deposit a 90-day bond that is refunded when the goods leave the country.</p>

<p>Argentina is not a party to the A.T.A. (Temporary Admission) Carnet program of the U.S. Council for International Business to import goods, display booths, and literature for display in local trade shows for subsequent re-export. The Argentine Temporary Admission Regime (TAR) allows duty free admission of goods such as commercial samples, packaging, pallets, containers, and goods for exhibits. These items must be re-exported within the timeframe stipulated by Customs on entering the country. Many trade show organizers are able to obtain a special waiver from the Argentine government on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<h5>Market Estimates</h5>

<p><img src="../images/agricultural-market-estimates.png" alt="Argentina" /></p>

<h5>Overview</h5>

<p>Projected growth for 2013 and beyond has been affected by Government regulations limiting imports and access to foreign exchange.</p>

<p>The Argentine agricultural machinery market is growing as a result of good rain in 2012 following drought in 2011 and solid international commodity prices. The agricultural machinery market is projected at $1 billion in 2013. The agricultural machinery and equipment industry in Argentina is long-established and was one of the first industries to develop because of agriculture’s historically predominant role in the Argentine economy. Domestic production of agricultural machinery and equipment accounts for between 15 and 35 percent of the total market, depending on the product. There are approximately 130 manufacturers of a wide variety of machinery and many of them rely on imported key parts and components that present opportunities for U.S. suppliers. Distribution agreements, joint-ventures with domestic manufacturers and licensing are potential options, but U.S. firms should choose their partners carefully given that protection of intellectual property is a continuing challenge and some local Argentine firms have been known to copy patented foreign designs.</p>

<p>Return to Top</p>

<h5>Sub-Sector Best Prospects</h5>

<p>Irrigation Equipment: The Argentine market for irrigation systems has been growing in recent years due to the increased amount of Argentine farmland dedicated to row crops. Currently, 3.6 million acres, or less than five percent of farmland, is under irrigation. Specialists indicate that at least 20 percent of total farmland could benefit from irrigation. The U.S. dominates imports in this sector, accounting for over 50 percent of imports.</p>

<p>Parts and Components: This subsector currently represents approximately 10 percent of the annual sales value of tractors and harvesters, with a large number of small Argentine producers of agricultural implements and some domestic production of tractors and combines. Gradually, Argentine agricultural producers are integrating technologies that help to minimize use of agricultural inputs while not reducing yield and draw on foreign suppliers for key components. This offers opportunities in technologies ranging from precision agriculture to key components for domestically manufactured equipment such as self-propelled sprayers.</p>

<p>Return to Top</p>

<h5>Opportunities</h5>

<p>Products offering cost savings on the use of seed, fertilizer and agrochemicals are most in demand, especially those which incorporate a high level of nutrients in order to maintain yields and improve the quality of the products: information technology services for agriculture via wireless connections and Wi-Max networks; seeder pumps; GPS; data collection equipment for soil analysis, crop yields, remote sensing applications; and sprayer nozzles. Please note that used and remanufactured/reconditioned machinery and parts cannot be imported to Argentina.</p>

<p>However, recent controls imposed by the Argentine government have made exporting goods from any country to Argentina more difficult. It is important for would-be exporters to Argentina to confirm that their Argentine customer has received all the necessary permits (see “Trade Regulations and Standards” report for more information).</p>

<p>Return to Top</p>

<h5>Web Resources</h5>

<p>The best way to familiarize a potential local partner or buyer to a U.S. company’s product line is to exhibit in local trade shows, the largest one being Expoagro (<a href="http://expoagro.com.ar/site/en/index.php">http://expoagro.com.ar/site/en/index.php</a>).</p>

<h5>Overview</h5>

<p>Argentina’s cattle herd is approximately 51 million head. Roughly 2.1 million cows are in dairy production, and about 20.9 million cows are for beef production. The quality of both dairy and beef herds are very good, but need to continuously incorporate the latest high quality genetics to keep up the standard. The majority of imported semen is from dairy breeds, but imports of beef genetics have increased significantly over the past few years. The U.S. accounts for almost two-thirds of the total imported semen market, followed by Canada.</p>

<p>Return to Top</p>

<h5>Sub-Sector Best Prospects</h5>

<p>Both dairy and beef semen (especially Angus) have good potential growth in 2014.</p>

<p>Return to Top</p>

<h5>Opportunities</h5>

<p>Anticipated good returns in both dairy and beef sectors will continue to encourage new investment, including a larger use of artificial insemination and the use of higher quality genetics. The use of beef semen with production data is increasing, but semen distributors indicate that much needed education has to be done with breeders. Overall, imports of Black and Red Angus, Braford, Brangus, and Hereford semen have the greatest potential. Semen of Black and Red Angus and, to a lesser extent, Brangus have the greatest opportunities from the United States.</p>

<h5>Market Estimates</h5>

<p><img src="../images/top-agricultural-market-estimates2.png" alt="Argentina" /></p>

<h5>Overview</h5>

<p>The food and beverage (F&amp;B) industry is one of the main industries contributing to the Argentine economy, accounting for 33 percent of Argentina’s total exports. Some of its main trends are as follows: 1. significant investments in technology updates; 2. local production capacity being fully used, which requires additional investments to supply the growing food demand; 3. “Health and Nutrition” considered a strong concept in the F&amp;B business; 4. greater interaction between the local industry and universities, fostering innovation.</p>

<p>The main ingredients imported were those that are not manufactured locally or their production is not sufficient to supply the local industry. There is a significant market for some U.S. food ingredients among local producers of ingredients, who use them to manufacture high-value, tailor-made food products. However, Argentine F&amp;B imports for 2013 are projected to slightly decline, as a result of the slowdown of the country’s economy, and the trade restrictive measures taken by the government of Argentina (GOA) which are adversely affecting imports. The GOA is expected to continue to closely monitor imports as a means of trying to maintain a surplus trade balance by restricting imports and promoting exports.</p>

<h5>Opportunities</h5>

<p>U.S. food ingredients are locally considered to be high quality and safe products. As a consequence of the declining value of the Argentine peso vis-à-vis the dollar, U.S. products are still more competitive than European products. Best opportunities are for tailor-made food ingredients that are demanded for the manufacturing of more sophisticated food items, and ingredients that are not produced locally</p>

<h5>Overview</h5>

<p>The Argentine seed industry offers numerous growth prospects and opportunities in terms of
an increase in the demand for genetically modified seeds, higher commodity prices, and the
expansion of agricultural land area. Planting seeds are one of the most important agricultural
products imported into Argentina from the United States, totaling $23 million in 2012.</p>

<h5>Opportunities</h5>

<p>Off-season production of corn and soybean seed has generated positive returns in the last few
years. Total exports of planting seeds for 2013 are estimated at $190 million. Total exports
of planting seeds for 2012 were $163 million.</p>

<p>The new development of marginal areas for beef and dairy industries will mean that demand
for quality forage seeds will remain high. There is a strong demand for grasses suitable for
sub-tropical regions in the northern part of the country.</p>

<h5>Market Estimates</h5>

<p><img src="../images/electronic-market-estimates.png" alt="Argentina" /></p>

<h5>Overview</h5>

<p>In 2012, the Argentine electronic security sector market was valued at approximately $645 million dollars, making it a relatively large and growing sector for U.S. firms, especially in electronic security-related products, equipment, and services.</p>

<p>Despite the economic challenges facing the global economy, the electronic security sector in Argentina grew 31 percent in 2012. Local trade contacts estimate growth of 20 to 30 percent in 2013. This increase is largely attributed to rising crime, the high levels of perceived insecurity, and the increasing priority of improving workplace safety. This expansion has been seen in all sub-sectors of products and services of electronic security, especially for monitoring, CCTV over IP, intrusion control and law enforcement equipment, together totaling over 80 percent of electronic security imports to Argentina.</p>

<p>Hi-tech imports play a significant role in the overall security market, as domestic manufacturing is primarily focused on the production of basic security equipment and safety supplies. Thus, the hi-tech security equipment market presents the greatest opportunities for U.S. companies. The greatest potential for growth lies in such applications as online digital video surveillance and intelligent software with capabilities such as pausing, zooming, identification of specific objects and persons through facial expressions, thermal and night vision features.</p>

<p>• High-tech security equipment for Police and other law enforcement agencies.</p>

<p>• Safety and security design consulting services.</p>

<p>Return to Top</p>

<h5>Opportunities</h5>

<p>Market growth in recent years reflects the rising crime rate in Argentina. Acts of violence, including street crime, bank robberies, and private property theft, have been on the rise. While Argentina’s crime rate is lower than in the U.S., Brazil, Mexico, or Venezuela, crime is an issue that has been emphasized in the press. The widespread perception of growing insecurity, along with the increasing priority of improving workplace security, has contributed to the growth of the electronic security sector in Argentina, which grew 31 percent in 2012.</p>

<p>In addition to these changes, a trend has been to import parts for fire and safety equipment. Although there has been an increase of local assembly of alarms, detectors, and electronic fire systems to offer significantly lower prices and to take advantage of the “Buy Argentina” law and tax benefits, high-tech imports will continue to play a significant role in the overall security market, since domestic manufacturers tend to satisfy the demand for less sophisticated equipment.</p>

<p>Argentina continues to present many opportunities to U.S. exporters. However, recent controls imposed by the Argentine government have made exporting goods from any country to Argentina more difficult. It is important for would-be exporters to Argentina to confirm that their Argentine customer has received all the necessary permits (see “Trade Regulations and Standards” report for more information).</p>

<h5>Market Estimates</h5>

<p><img src="../images/mining-market-estimates.png" alt="Argentina" /></p>

<h5>Overview</h5>

<p>The mining industry in Argentina continues to expand following a sustained upward trend. Nevertheless, a significant number of mining projects throughout Argentina have not reached full development. Regulatory changes in general investment legislation and in specific mining-sector legislation in the early 1990s favored a significant increase in foreign investment in the industry. The sector’s growth propelled local demand for mining machinery and equipment. Most of the 250+ companies with operations in Argentina reduced their activity level significantly during the economic crisis in order to preserve their assets. Most of the market players are junior companies; however, sector dynamics and industry experts coincide that investments will continue to increase.</p>

<p>Several new mines are expected to be built in this decade, which represent future business opportunities for U.S. suppliers of mining equipment and machinery. Nevertheless, existing mines currently in operation also represent significant potential for the provision of machinery, equipment and parts.</p>

<h3>Renewable Energy Technology and Equipment</h3>

<ul>
<li>Overview</li>
<li>Sub-Sector Best Prospects</li>
<li>Opportunities</li>
</ul>


<h5>Overview</h5>

<p>Argentina’s carbon footprint from power generation is low, with about 90 percent of power generation in Argentina coming from hydro sources and thermal plants fired by natural gas, and a further seven percent from nuclear power. As Argentina's total electricity demand continues to grow, increasing the consumption of hydropower could significantly reduce the country's emissions of greenhouse gases. Hydropower, however, has been controversial, including charges that hydroelectric dams in Argentina are responsible for displacing some Argentines and for significant environmental impact.</p>

<p>Argentina is poised to develop wind power. The country features one of the world’s top three wind corridors, located in southern Argentina (Patagonia). Historically, wind power has been used minimally, mainly for pumping drinking water. However, wind power has been attracting significant attention recently as an economically viable source of electric power. In some parts of the Patagonian south, strong westerly winds blow at an average rate of 36 miles per hour. In Patagonia, the use of wind power has been promoted by independent electric cooperatives for several rural areas which do not have access to the federal electricity grid. U.S. products have very good market potential in Argentina. In fact, the U.S. ranks among the top three suppliers of technology for both solar and wind power generation. As Argentina’s alternative energy sector continues expanding, the market will continue to offer business opportunities to U.S. suppliers.</p>

<p>Argentina approved legislation which stipulates that energy utilities must purchase wind-generated electricity if it is made available to them. Although investors are starting to fund the construction of new wind farms, it remains very costly to transmit electricity produced in the south all the way to areas in the north, where demand is highest. The GOA estimates that as much as 15 percent of the country's energy needs could potentially be met by wind power by 2020. It has issued contracts to complete the linkage of southern Patagonia to the national power grid. This may reduce the marginal cost of power transmission to the north, even though it will still be expensive. A number of hydroelectric projects in Santa Cruz Province could also take advantage of this connection. In 2009, the GOA issued a tender for the provision of 1,000 MW from renewable energy sources, half of it from wind. One project has been finalized, and a few more are underway.</p>

<p>As one of the world’s largest agricultural countries, Argentina holds great potential for biofuels. Argentina is already the world's largest exporter and the fourth largest producer of biodiesel, mostly made from soybean oil. A biofuels law mandates a five percent biofuels mix in gasoline and diesel, starting in 2010. The USG and the GOA signed a bilateral cooperation agreement on renewable energy in 2011.</p>

<h5>Sub-Sector Best Prospects</h5>

<p>U.S. products have very good market potential in Argentina. In fact, the U.S. ranks among the top preferred suppliers of green power technology.</p>

<p>Return to Top</p>

<h5>Opportunities</h5>

<p>Biofuels, biomass, wind and solar energy hold huge potential in Argentina. However, the market for wind and solar generation seems to be more promising given its stage of development. Direct sales to municipal governments, electric cooperatives, and private companies are common. Support by a local reputable partner is important, as local financing is scarce.</p>

<p>Argentina remains a key market for U.S. exports to Latin America. However, recent controls imposed by the Argentine government have made exporting goods from any country to Argentina more difficult. It is important for would-be exporters to Argentina to confirm that their Argentine customer has received all the necessary permits (See “Trade Regulations and Standards” report for more information).</p>

<h5>Market Estimates</h5>

<p><img src="../images/travel-market-estimates.png" alt="Argentina" /></p>

<h5>Overview</h5>

<p>Traveling is part of the Argentine lifestyle and the U.S. is a popular destination for both business and pleasure. Based on the most recent figures travel to the U.S. is up 19.2 percent January to November 2012, compared to the same period in 2011. Although Argentine tourism has grown at double digit rates over the past years, growth in 2013 could slow due to GOA restrictions on the purchase of foreign currency and taxes on airline tickets to non-Argentine destinations and credit card charges made by Argentine tourists when overseas. During 2014, many Argentines will likely choose Brazil as a travel destination due to its proximity as well as to attend the popular FIFA World Cup (Copa Mundial de Furbol) hosted by Brazil.</p>

<p>The Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that Argentines spend $5,000 per person on travel expenses to the U.S. (including airfare generated by U.S. carriers). This comes as good news for travel agents, airlines, destinations, hotel managers, and many other travel service providers.</p>

<p>The number of travelers varies seasonally. Peak travel times tend to be during the summer holidays (December-February) and winter school holidays (July) although some choose to travel during the week of September 21st, as many children receive a spring holiday then in addition to their other times off.</p>

<p>Return to Top</p>

<h5>Sub-Sector Best Prospects</h5>

<p>New tourism destinations are being actively promoted at major industry shows, and the business travel sector experienced substantial growth last year, as many Argentines are visiting trade shows and congresses in a wide variety of industry sectors.</p>

<p>Return to Top</p>

<h5>Opportunities</h5>

<p>The top destinations frequently visited by Argentines are Florida (especially Miami and Orlando), New York City, California, and Washington D.C. The U.S. gateways are Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, Miami, New York, and New Jersey (Newark Airport).</p>
