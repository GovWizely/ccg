<p>In 2013, the Government of Brazil (GOB) published the National Defense White Book (LBDN) which clarifies Brazil’s defense activities and updates the country’s 2008 National Defense Strategy and National Defense Policy. The LBDN is a key document, in which the Brazilian defense authorities describe and prioritize Brazilian defense related projects. According to the Ministry of Defense, resources for funding and investment for the Armed Forces have grown 103% in the past six years. Since 2008, when the GOB established the National Defense Strategy (END), the amount has increased from R$9.6 billion (US$4.2 billion) to R$19.6 billion (US$8.5 billion) as of 2014. Despite this fact, the Armed Forces are not receiving adequate budgets in 2014 to continue with their programs.</p>

<h3>Sub-Sector Best Prospects</h3>

<p>Return to top</p>

<p>The 2014 draft budget law foresees R$72.8 billion, approximately US$31 billion for the defense sector. From this total, 73% are for expenses with staff. The Brazilian Navy requested R$12 billion (US$5.2 billion) for its programs in 2014, but expects to receive R$5.5 billion. The Brazilian Army and the Brazilian Air Force anticipate R$5.8 billion and R$4.8 billion, respectively.</p>

<p>According to the Defense Articulation and Equipment Plan (Plano de Articulação e Equipamento de Defesa; PAED), the Ministry of Defense has identified and is coordinating the following priority projects for the armed forces:</p>

<p>Brazilian Navy: The Brazilian Navy has seven priority projects to be implemented by 2031, valued at R$211 Billion (US$119 Billion). The most important navy opportunities for U.S. companies include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Navy Nuclear Program: In addition to the continued development of Brazil’s nuclear submarine program, the Navy’s program also includes: analysis and development of the nuclear fuel cycle in submarines, certification of the Navy’s nuclear-electric energy generation lab (LABGENE), construction of a prototype reactor, and an upgrade to the Navy’s Technological Center in São Paulo</p></li>
<li><p>Navy Modernization Program: This is an extensive program that includes the gradual replacement of naval air and sea combat platforms. Some of the projects include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Submarine Development Program (Programa de Desenvolvimento de Submarinos; PROSUB), program to develop non-nuclear submarines</p></li>
<li><p>Surface Vessel Procurement Program (Programa de Obtenção de Meios de Superfície; PROSUPER), a program for five, 1,800-ton ocean patrol vessels, five 6,000-ton frigates and a single support vessel, all of which are to be built locally in cooperation with Brazilian companies according to Brazilian law and offset requirements</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Amazon Blue Management System (Sistema de Gerenciamento da Amazônia Azul; SisGAAz), a Navy program for the surveillance and monitoring of Brazilian waters. SisGAAz aims to increase efficiency of search and rescue operations and is to be co-developed with the police. Full implementation is scheduled by 2024</p></li>
<li><p>Navigation Safety: This project foresees the expansion of the Brazilian Navy presence in the Amazon and Midwest region, as well as surveillance in border areas and large river basins.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Brazilian Army:</strong> The Brazilian Army’s strategic priority projects aim to equip brigades with equipment, weapons, transportation and supplies according to their growing needs. The projects will be implemented by 2035 with a total estimated value of R$ 60 billion (US 26 billion):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Army Modernization Program: Includes modernization and revitalization of M60 combat vehicles, Leopard 1A1 and M113 armored vehicles. The program also includes the acquisition of river vessels, vehicles, artillery equipment, ammunition, and IA2 rifles developed locally by the Brazilian arms industry.</p></li>
<li><p>Cyber Defense: This area includes the construction of a Cyber Defense Center, and entails acquisition of software and hardware solutions for that center.</p></li>
<li><p>Guarani: This project calls for the introduction of a new family of wheeled armored vehicles, involving the purchase of 2,044 armored vehicles over the next 20 years. Includes several subprojects such as research and development, integrated logistic support, nationalization of ammunition, infrastructure and professional training.</p></li>
<li><p>Integrated Border Monitoring System (Sistema Integrado de Monitoramento de Fronteiras; SISFRON, a system to protect Brazil’s borders. The project is divided into nine phases, the first of which was tendered in 2012 and was won by Consortium Tepro, a group made up of Savis Tecnologia e Sistemas S/A, OrbiSat Industrie and Aerolevantamento.</p></li>
<li><p>Protection of Strategic Ground Structures (Proteção de Estruturas Estratégicas Terrestres; PROTEGER),a complex system designed around developing elite ground forces to protect strategic infrastructures and systems whose total or partial destruction would be a threat to national security. It will be integrated with other security systems, and will be under Ministry of Defense supervision and coordinated by the Ground Operations Command.</p></li>
<li><p>Antiaircraft System: This project’s goal is to upgrade the existing air defense system in order to meet the requirements of the Brazilian Aerospace Defense System (Sistema de Defesa Aeroespacial Brasileiro; SISDABRA). The anti-aircraft artillery will be equipped with modern instruments and sensors, and assisted by an integrated logistics system that supports the equipment during its life cycle.</p></li>
<li><p>Astros 2020: a program to protect Brazil’s borders, this includes development of a rocket/missile system with a range of up to 300 km, called Astros 2020. The Army intends to have two sets of missile launchers and rockets.</p></li>

<h3>Opportunities</h3>

<p>Return to top</p>

<p>To conduct business with the Brazilian Armed Forces, companies must be prepared for long and complex campaigns. As in most industries, having a local office or a trusted and well-respected local representative with extensive contacts and a solid sales record is mandatory business practice in order to succeed in Brazil. In addition to the ever-present desire for offsets, U.S. firms must be prepared to transfer technology (subject to U.S. Government approval) and engage in a solid and long term partnership with Brazilian aerospace and defense industry for co-development and local production of components, parts, and assembly.</p>

<p>Defense equipment acquisition programs tend to move at a much slower pace in Brazil. The Brazilian Armed Forces have long-term acquisition plans that include: weapons, escort ship platforms, submarines, transport ships, offshore patrol vessels, tugs and hydrographic/oceanographic ships, UAVs, long range radars, helicopters, jetfighters and tactical radio communication systems among others.</p>
