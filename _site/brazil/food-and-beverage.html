<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Return to top</p>

<p>While Brazil is a major agricultural country with a modern food processing sector, there are export opportunities for U.S. companies. In 2012, Brazil imported consumer-oriented food products valued at US$4.2 billion, up 4 percent from the previous year. Mercosul* countries and the European Union captured the lion’s share of this market, registering 44 percent and 24 percent market share, respectively. U.S. exports reached US$273 million, a seven percent market share. Although up a full point from 2011, the United States must establish a more aggressive approach toward the Brazilian market if U.S. companies are to significantly increase exports of food and agricultural product.</p>

<p><em>(*) MERCOSUL is the Southern Common Market, comprised of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Venezuela, which promotes free trade of goods, services, and production inputs.</em></p>

<p><strong>Sub-Sector Best Prospects</strong></p>

<p><strong>Products present in the market which have good sales potential</strong></p>

<p>Importers are generally looking for well-known brands and high-end products. Brazilian importers/distributors usually prefer products with nine months shelf life or more. In addition to the product itself, packaging, status and level of innovation are important attributes. Products that combine these characteristics are more likely to successfully enter the market. Currently, the food categories that are most exported to Brazil from the United States are: meat products, eggs and products, dairy products, fresh fruit, processed fruit, processed vegetables, fruit and vegetable juices, tree nuts, chocolate and cocoa products, snack foods, breakfast cereals, condiments and sauces, prepared food, wine, beer, distilled spirits, non-alcoholic beverages (ex. juices) and fish products.</p>

<h3>Opportunities</h3>

<p><strong>Products not present in significant quantities, but which have good sales potential</strong></p>

<p>Health foods, especially natural and organic products, have a limited presence in the Brazilian market. Although increasing at a fast pace of 30- 35 percent per year, the local industry has not directed consistent efforts to develop this segment. There are a limited number of local suppliers offering processed organic products in the market; consequently, prices for these items are still high for the average consumer. U.S. suppliers may find great opportunities within this niche. Brazil requires the use of the organic stamp on all organic products. In order to receive approval for its use, organic producers must comply with regulations, which mean that a local certifying agent, accredited by MAPA, must assure the product is produced according to MAPA’s standards. Other food categories being sought by local importers are lactose free products, kosher products, diet products, gluten free products, baby formula, and functional foods.</p>
