<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Return to top</p>

<p>Brazil is experiencing major growth in the ACE industry. The country has captured global attention as its major cities undergo a construction boom related to the 2014 World Cup and, specifically for Rio de Janeiro, the Summer Olympic Games in 2016.</p>

<p>The Government of the State of Rio de Janeiro estimates that investments in the State between 2010 and 2016 will reach US$ 50 billion, in sectors including infrastructure, construction, transportation and others. Most of these investments will be done under Brazil’s Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs).</p>

<p>Architectural design and engineering projects around the country, from roads and stadiums to airports and retail space, are abundant. Although there is strong competition from local firms, U.S. ACE firms with niche expertise are welcome to do business in Brazil, provided they understand the regulatory procedures for being able to work in Brazil.</p>

<p>More details can be found in the report titled “Opportunities for U.S. Architectural &amp; Engineering Design Services in Brazil”, which can be found at: <a href="http://buyusainfo.net/docs/x_6001335.pdf">http://buyusainfo.net/docs/x_6001335.pdf</a></p>

<p><strong>Market Challenges</strong></p>

<p>In order for U.S. ACE companies to do business in Brazil, there are two general options. The first is for a U.S. company to partner with a local firm that is licensed to provide architectural/engineering services in Brazil. As with most services imported to Brazil, the Brazilian firm using the service will have to pay additional costs of up to 40% of the price of the services rendered. To avoid this process, a U.S. firm may prefer to set up a business in Brazil directly and obtain the license to provide such services in Brazil. This option works for U.S. firms looking to do business in Brazil over the long-term, as starting a business in Brazil and obtaining the necessary approvals to do architectural or engineering work is not a short-term process.</p>

<p>According to the Ministry of Development, Industry, and Foreign Trade (MDIC), Brazilian authorities have significantly reduced the amount of time required to grant various licenses and registrations over the past few years. Having service providers such as lawyers, customs brokers and accounting firms is essential to understand how the business environment works. They can assist once a company has chosen which method of market entry works best, such as opening a subsidiary or establishing a joint-venture partnership.</p>

<h3>Sub-Sector Best Prospects</h3>

<p>Return to top</p>

<p><strong>Government Investments</strong></p>

<p>Best prospects in the architectural, engineering and construction sectors can be found in areas such as commercial real estate, airports, ports, hotels, hospitals, and include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Urban projects: ports (e.g., the Port of Rio re-development - design of the walkways, buildingsalong the port), airports (privatization brings about opportunities for design work and other projects), traffic, transportation, parking, sporting venues</p></li>
<li><p>Airport design</p></li>
<li><p>Real estate, new or retrofit</p></li>
<li><p>Industrial, new or planned plants extensions</p></li>
<li><p>Hospitality, including new or refurbished hotels, and transformation of residential buildings into hotels</p></li>
<li><p>Healthcare (new hospitals and upgrades to existing)</p></li>
<li><p>Low income housing projects planning;</p></li>
<li><p>Lighting, including residential, commercial, industrial, urban (LED is increasingly gaining popularity in Brazil)</p></li>
<li><p>HVAC</p></li>
<li><p>Furniture design</p></li>
<li><p>Drywall technologies</p></li>
<li><p>Landscaping, including gardens, golf courses, hotels, residential, commercial, industrial</p></li>
<li><p>Sport venues design and equipment, such as golf courses</p></li>
<li><p>Building Information Modeling (BIM) Process.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Many ACE projects are now being required to contain sustainable or “green” content, according to <strong>LEED, AQUA</strong> and other certification programs.</p>

<p>Despite the bureaucratic hurdles, many U.S. and international ACE companies find business in Brazil because of the high level of private sector and government investments in infrastructure. Also, with the growth of the country, residential housing is a booming sector, including both upscale residential projects and low income housing. The Government of Brazil (GOB) created an initiative called “Minha Casa, Minha Vida”, a program to build homes for Brazil’s working class over the next several years. This US$15.5 billion program, funded primarily by the federal government, aims to help alleviate the country’s estimated 6 million-unit housing deficit. By the end of 2013, 1.4 million homes were built. By 2014, the GOB will reach the established goal of 2.75 million homes built through this program.</p>

<p>The Brazilian Equipment and Maintenance Technology Association (Sobratema) states that the infrastructure sector will receive an estimated US$800 billion in investments from 2013 through 2017. The sum will be divided between the energy and infrastructure sectors, with a larger amount allocated for infrastructure development such as roads, rail, ports and stadiums:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>US$66.5 billion will be invested over 25 years in building 7,500 km of highways and 10,000 km of railways.</p></li>
<li><p>US$3.15 billion will be invested in port terminals.</p></li>
<li><p>US$1.1 billion will be invested in ports.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>In the airport sector, five of the major airports have been recently privatized: Brasília, Guarulhos (São Paulo capital), Viracopos (Campinas, state of São Paulo), Antônio Carlos Jobim “Galeão” (Rio de Janeiro capital) and Confins (Belo Horizonte, capital of Minas Gerais State). The GOB will invest US$3.60 billion in 270 airports around the country, with the goal that 96% of Brazilians will be no more than 100 km from an airport. (See this #Chapter’s Airport Industry best prospect report or online at <a href="http://www.buyusainfo.net/docs/x_8093199.pdf">http://www.buyusainfo.net/docs/x_8093199.pdf</a>)</p>

<p>The GOB is also planning to ease labor laws and regulations in order to attract more investment. The investment forecasted over the upcoming years in infrastructure is approximately US$400 billion. This does not include investments already in place that are directly related to the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympic Games.</p>

<p>The future outlook seems positive, especially due to the model outlined in Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), through which concessions and privatizations in many infrastructure projects will receive further investments. These major investments will bring many opportunities for ACE firms that are capable and ready to do business in Brazil.</p>

<p>According to the Rio Convention and Visitor´s Bureau, there are 259 new hotels planned in Brazil to handle increasing numbers of visitors for the World Cup and Olympic Games, as well as the growth of the tourism sector throughout the country. This number represents more than 40% of the market for new hotels, vs. 331 new hotels in the rest of Latin American countries combined.</p>

<p>Large hotel companies such as Accor (six new hotel projects), Hilton, Hyatt, InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG), Groupe du Louvre, Marriott and Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts are all investing in high class properties. In 2015, a Ritz-Carlton Hotel with 130 rooms and suites will open its doors, and a new Grand Hyatt Hotel with 436 rooms is planned in Rio’s Barra da Tijuca area.</p>

<p><strong>The Olympic Games</strong></p>

<p>In August and September of 2016, Rio de Janeiro will host the first-ever Olympic Games in South America. This event will generate numerous investment and business opportunities for U.S. companies in several sectors. The main projects include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Logistics upgrades at seaports</p></li>
<li><p>Modernizing/enlarging the two Galeão International Airport terminals (increasing the airport's capacity from 15 million passengers per year to 25 million) at US$2.5 billion The widening of highways to accommodate “Olympic lanes”</p></li>
<li><p>Port of Rio revitalization to include a new 30,000 square meter leisure area featuring bars, restaurants, an amphitheater, museum, aquarium, a multi-use space and parking</p></li>
<li><p>Port dredging</p></li>
<li><p>Two new subway lines (US$1.8 billion)</p></li>
<li><p>Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system (US$1billion)</p></li>
<li><p>Housing projects (including low income housing)</p></li>
<li><p>Water sanitation projects.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Before the United Nations Rio +20 Conference was held in June 2012, it was estimated that there were approximately 32,000 hotel rooms in Rio to accommodate an estimated 50,000 conference attendees. However, partly because of the lack of quality hotel space and the high prices charged at the time, a number of official delegations cancelled their participation at the last minute.</p>

<p>Partly as a result of this crisis, and the expected turnout of tourists in many major Brazilian cities, the government is providing tax incentives that will create opportunities for refurbishing, building, acquiring or operating hotels. In addition to the new hotels, several hotels are also being refurbished and upgraded. There are also projects in the Northeast region (residential, hotels, industrial) and in other regions, namely Santos (São Paulo) region, where residential, hotel, and infrastructure projects such as underwater tunnels are underway, among others.</p>

<p>Also, port construction projects are underway in locations such as Porto do Açú in Rio de Janeiro State.</p>

<p>Note also that funding for projects is guaranteed with a significant appropriation by the GOB under its “Plan for Growth Acceleration” (PAC). This program encompasses investment in three major areas:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Logistics infrastructure (highways, railways, ports and airports)</p></li>
<li><p>Energy infrastructure (generation and distribution of electricity, production, exploration and transportation of petroleum, gas and biofuels)</p></li>
<li><p>Social and urban infrastructure (sanitation, housing, subways and urban rail).</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Opportunities</h3>

<p>Return to top</p>

<p>Although U.S. architectural firms face a competitive environment, many U.S. firms have been winning contracts. For example, U.S. firms have recently won design contracts in Rio de Janeiro related to the upcoming 2016 Olympic Village, the new golf course to be used for the Olympics, and the new Museum of Image and Sounds, to be relocated to the Copacabana area in Rio. U.S. engineering equipment providers have also been successful in the Brazilian market, several with a local presence, such as Caterpillar, John Deere, and Terex, among others.</p>

<p>However, many large procurement projects that involve construction and architectural design services are won by Brazilian engineering and construction companies such as Odebrecht, OAS and Camargo Correa, among others. Thus, the U.S. Commercial Service recommends that U.S. architectural and engineering firms with no physical presence in Brazil partner with Brazilian architecture, engineering and constructions firms before bidding directly on projects.</p>

<p>Brazil recognizes that in order to continue growing effectively, the nation needs to bring in expertise and technology that is currently not available or is in short supply in Brazil. This is where U.S. companies can play a role.</p>

<p>For a better understanding of the regulatory environment that architectural design firms face in Brazil, please read our report on licensing at: <a href="http://export.gov/brazil/games/eg_br_024085.asp">http://export.gov/brazil/games/eg_br_024085.asp</a></p>
