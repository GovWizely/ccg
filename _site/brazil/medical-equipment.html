<p>Total Market Size = US$ 6,830</p>

<p>Data Sources: ABIMED, ABIMO, ABIIS</p>

<p>Total Local Production: US$ 2,698</p>

<p>Total Exports: US$ 924</p>

<p>Total Imports: US$ 5,056</p>

<p>Imports from U.S.: US$1,516</p>

<p>Brazil is the largest medical equipment market in South America and should continue to expand. It is expected that this segment will regain double-digit annual growth in 2014, which was interrupted in 2012 due to the worldwide economic downturn and domestic strikes. Brazil is both a major medical equipment producer and importer. The industry is comprised of a number of related products and services, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Medical equipment and devices</li>
<li>Dental equipment and products</li>
<li>Radiological and diagnostic imaging equipment</li>
<li>Laboratory equipment</li>
</ul>


<p>Brazilian medical equipment revenues in 2013 reached an estimated US$6.8 billion, which represents an increase of 9.4 % from the previous year. U.S. products account for approximately 30% of the import market, mainly sold through local agents, distributors and importers to hospitals and clinics. The market for electro medicine equipment is around US$200 million, which represents approximately 50% of total sales in Latin America. In 2013, imports for in vitro diagnostics reagents and devices increased approximately 10%, reaching sales of US$230 million.</p>

<p>There are few, high-quality Brazilian manufacturers producing advanced medical equipment, forcing Brazil to rely on imports, a trend that will continue for quite some time. Local buyers view U.S. and other foreign products (mainly Canadian and European) as having high quality and reliability. Thus, financing terms often become the differentiating criteria in making a sale.</p>

<p>Anvisa, Brazil’s Health Surveillance Agency is the country’s national agency of sanitary surveillance that regulates registration of medical related products. Risk class III, IV and some II may demand international inspections for Good Manufacturing Products (GMP). Electrical and battery powered devices must receive certifications and the Brazilian Conformity Mark from Inmetro, the National Institute of Metrology, Quality and Technology that issues.</p>

<h3>Sub-Sector Best Prospects</h3>

<p>Return to top</p>

<p>Brazil’s strengthened currency has provided greater purchasing power for private and public hospitals. With continued expansion of Brazil’s private health care sector, the market should continue to grow. Approximately 80% of all products used in hospitals in Brazil must be imported, because the country has no manufacturing of comparable products. New opportunities for US exporters abound, particularly for:</p>

<ul>
<li>More advanced medical equipment</li>
<li>Disposables</li>
<li>Diagnostic devices</li>
<li>Implants and components</li>
</ul>


<h3>Opportunities</h3>

<p>Return to top</p>

<p>The market for home health care products has been increasing in recent years. Brazilian health insurance companies are responsible for paying 99% of the costs related to home care treatment. As such, the U.S. Commercial Service sees the market for home health care products growing dramatically within the coming years.</p>

<p>The Government of Brazil is offering opportunities to companies that are interested in partnerships to transfer technology for domestic production through its public private partnership program, in an effort to reduce the deficit trade balance in the health care sector. U.S. exporters may consider the opportunities offered by Mercosur* for companies that manufacture or assemble medical devices in Brazil. It is possible to use it as a "spring board" for export into other South American countries.</p>

<p>Since compulsory product registration before sale is required for all of Mercosur countries, US exporters should consult a local lawyer/consultant before signing a contract with any agent/distributor.</p>

<p>(* ) Mercosur (Mercado del Sur) is composed of 5 sovereign member states: Argentina; Brazil; Paraguay; Uruguay; and Venezuela. Bolivia became an acceding member on 7 December 2012.</p>
