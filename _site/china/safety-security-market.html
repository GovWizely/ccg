<h4>Overview</h4>

<p>Return to top</p>

<p>China's safety and security market exceeded $4.12 billion in 2011. As one of the world's fastest growing economies, China is undertaking numerous, large-scale projects including airports, sports stadiums, and metro systems that will require extensive security systems. In addition, municipalities are installing emergency response systems to improve security and bolster response times. On a consumer level, China's growing middle class is demanding high-quality, residential security equipment and services. Before selling in China, U.S. exporters need to be aware of Chinese certification requirements, as well as potential U.S. export controls. Overall, the sector is expected to maintain rapid growth and create export opportunities by expanding to an estimated $8.5 billion by 2015.</p>

<h4>Sub-Sector Best Prospects</h4>

<p>Return to top</p>

<p>Much of the demand in the safety and security industry is related to digital technology, security guard communications systems, network technology for inspection control systems, and emergency warning systems.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Inspection control systems: This will continue to be a high-growth sector. Panasonic, Samsung, Sony, JVC, and Sanyo dominate the market in China's high-grade inspection control market.</p></li>
<li><p>Security guard communication systems: China's domestic enterprises dominate in this sector and foreign enterprises such as U.S. companies BlI and HID, the UK's TDSI, and Israel's DDS occupy the majority of the security guard communications market.</p></li>
<li><p>Emergency warning systems: There is high demand for intelligent airport systems. Foreign companies dominate the market for high-end products, leading the trend towards integrated safety and security systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Detection Equipment: Since China's domestic manufacturers lack capacity to supply the market, foreign products in this field are in high demand.</p></li>
</ul>


<h4>Opportunities</h4>

<p>Return to top</p>

<p>The safety and security sector remains a highly-regulated industry in China. In most cases, when local safety and security engineering companies win tenders for large projects, they need to import equipment and technology. U.S. exporters should look for opportunities to provide products and to partner with Chinese engineering firms that often have strong connections with the Chinese Government.</p>
