<h4>Overview</h4>

<p>Franchising shows promise in China. Statistics from China Chainstore &amp; Franchise Association (CCFA) show that enterprises from more than 70 industries have applied for franchise operations, including enterprises from the traditional sectors of catering, retailing, and individual and business services. Currently, China has 4,500 franchises and chain store companies creating over 5 million jobs nationwide.</p>

<p>Challenges to U.S. franchise firms include a relatively weak regulatory system, increasing costs of labor and real estate and a lack of qualified Chinese franchisee candidates. The most recent legislation released by the Ministry of Commerce stipulates that franchise firms can start franchising in China as long as they own and operate two company-owned stores for one year in any part of the world. In addition, franchise firms must file with the local commercial authority for record within 15 days after the execution of the initial franchise contract.</p>

<h4>Best Products / Services</h4>

<p>The Chinese franchising market is dominated by traditional franchise operations like food and beverage (F&amp;B) and retail outlets. According to CCFA, nearly 40 percent of all franchisers in China are engaged in such industries. U.S. franchisers established a particularly strong foothold in the F&amp;B market.</p>

<p>Franchising opportunities abound in non-F&amp;B industries. The best prospects in this form of franchising include sectors such as car rental and services, budget hotel chains, general business services and fitness.</p>

<h4>Success Factors to Consider</h4>

<p>Major international franchise firms have established the following best practices for doing business in China:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Register the brand in China before entering the China market.</p></li>
<li><p>Find local partners who can help navigate the local business environment.</p></li>
<li><p>Understand the cultural differences and adjust market access strategies accordingly.</p></li>
<li><p>Have an ability and willingness to localize your product if necessary, without changing the core product.</p></li>
<li><p>Minimize the price of the final product and the franchising fee to achieve rapid expansion and mass acceptance.</p></li>
<li><p>Manage government relations by establishing and maintaining solid working relationships with relevant Chinese Government agencies.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Foreign franchise brands are receiving greater interest from second and third-tier market developers. Additionally, we are seeing an increase in F&amp;B companies entering the market as wholly owned enterprises to manage the brand, demonstrate proof-of-concept and create a strong foothold prior to expanding into the franchise model.</p>
