<h4>Overview</h4>

<p>Return to top</p>

<p>China is now the world's second largest market for medical equipment. Based on the information from China Association for Medical Devices Industry (CAMDI), in recent years China's medical equipment market has been growing at 15 percent annually, and reached a total size of RMB 100 billion in 2010 (about US$156 million), ranking second in the world behind the United States. The domestic production volume of low to mid-range medical equipment and products ranked top in the world at 75 percent; high-end products only accounted for 25 percent, showing that the majority of medical equipment and products produced by domestic Chinese manufacturers are low-tech. Several foreign companies such as General Electric (GE), Philips, and Hitachi supply 80 percent of China's high-end medical equipment. Clinical laboratory equipment and reagent sales are growing at about 15 percent to 20 percent annually.</p>

<p>According to statistics from the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Medicines and Health Products (CCCMHPIE), by the end of 2010 China's import and export value of medical equipment reached $22.7 billion, an increase of 23.47 percent over 2009. For more detailed information, refer to the list below of top three countries and market share in the import and export of medical equipment to China in 2010.</p>

<p>China's healthcare market is severely underdeveloped and offers significant potential for U.S. companies interested in expanding into the Chinese market. The Chinese Government has mandated $124 billion to develop basic healthcare infrastructure in hopes of providing basic healthcare coverage for all Chinese. China has over 20,000 hospitals, 85 percent of which are publicly-owned; the remaining 15 percent, approximately 2,000 hospitals, are private or China-foreign joint venture hospitals. Due to China's aging population, uneven location of medical resources, and chronic diseases, existing healthcare services cannot meet the huge demand of the current population. To narrow the gap between the huge demand for healthcare services and the shortage of public resources and hospitals, the government is encouraging social capital or investment into high-end or privately-owned hospitals to meet the gap of public hospitals in its 12th FYP. More privately-owned or foreign-invested hospitals are expected to be established in China. Growth of hospitals will encourage the development of the medical device market in China.</p>

<p>Chinese end-users consider U.S. products to be of superior quality and the most technologically advanced. China's hospitals particularly welcome medical equipment and products with high-technology content. At the same time, domestic medical device companies are consolidating, upgrading quality, and beginning to compete in medium-level technology niches.</p>

<p>Barriers exist with an uncertain regulatory environment and extensive delays in registration and re-registration of products, although efforts are reportedly being made to reduce the large backlog. Additionally, pricing, tender, and bar code systems also play a role of delaying a company's entry into the Chinese medical device market.</p>
